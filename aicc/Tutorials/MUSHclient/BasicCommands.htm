<p>MUSHclient 101 - Basic Commands  </p>
 
<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do some basic things with your bot
 in MUSHclient such as  <br>
  dream entry, movement, actions, and changing maps.  </p>
 
<p>One of the first triggers you'll need for your MUSHclient bot is used
for dream entry. Click the<br>
  Triggers button, then click the Add button on the triggers window. In the
 Trigger textbox, type<br>
 <i> ]q*</i>, then in the Send textbox type <i>vascodagama</i>. Click the 
OK button and close the Triggers  <br>
  window. The word <i>vascodagama</i> is the trigger word that allows a character
 into a dream. So when  your bot enters a dream portal, it sends <i>vascodagama
</i>to Furcadia and it is sent into the dream.  </p>
 
<p>Now that you've got your bot into a dream, you probably want to move it
 to a specific location in  the dream. To move your bot type one of the following
commands and press  enter to get the  <br>
  corresponding effects:   </p>
 
<p><i>m 1</i> to move it one space to the southwest <br>
 <i> m 3</i> to move it one space to the southeast <br>
 <i> m 7</i> to move it one space to the northwest <br>
 <i> m 9</i> to move it one space to the northeast  </p>
 
<p>If you want to repeat the same movement command several times you can
press the Up key while the  text cursor is in the MUSHclient textbox, which
makes the last text typed reappear then press enter.  If you want your bot
to sit, stand, lie down, turn, get, or use type one of the following commands
 and press enter to make it do the corresponding action:  </p>
 
<p><i>sit</i> to make the bot sit <br>
  <i>stand </i>to make the bot stand <br>
  <i>lie </i>to make the bot lie down <br>
 <i> &lt;</i> to make the bot turn counterclockwise <br>
 <i> &gt;</i> to make the bot turn clockwise <br>
  <i>get </i>to make the bot get an object <br>
  <i>use </i>to make the bot use an object  </p>
 
<p>Bots are only allowed on Allegria Island and dreams. To move your bot
to Allegria Island type  <br>
<i>  goalleg</i> and press enter.  </p>
