<center><b><font size="+3">Store The Value of a Roll</font></b></center>
<p>Create a trigger and name it <i>Store Roll Value</i>. </p>
<p>The When statement should look like th following: When Furcadia sends command
# [#] * rolls * gets *. </p>
<p>Add a Then statement and select <i>Store #1 to variable #2</i>. </p>
<p>In the first textbox type <i>[word3]</i>. In the second textbox type <i>
[tmpRoll]</i>. Click Update. Clik Update again. Click Close. Save your bot.
</p>
<p>Tip: Add another Then statement that has the bot emit the value of [tmpRoll]
 so that you know the trigger is successful. You can name the variable you're
 using to store the die roll anything you like. </p>
<p>Extras: You can add an And statement to check to see if they furson rolling 
is a certain furson. Add this And statement to do that: <i>variable [tmpFtr1] 
is [word1]</i>. You will have to have stored a fursons name to the variable
[tmpFtr1] before this trigger is set off for this to work. </p>
