While reading this tutorial you will hopefully learn  how to use a Log to
store information. The example in this book stores names  of members of a
guild. We start by adding an Action and naming it <i>Add Member</i>.  Change
your If statment to look like the following: <i>If * Whispers me join</i>
.  Now when anyone whispers the bot 'join' this Action will be triggered.<br>
<br>
Now add a statment to the Then box. Choose <i>$LOG: Register (add) record 
#1 to file #2</i> from the pulldown menu. Type <i>[player]</i> in the first
box and  type <i>members.txt</i> in the second textbox. Click Update. When
FurBot creates  a file such as a log it creates the file in the same folder
as your Furcadia  client (Furcadia.exe) so if you want to look at the file
you can find it there. Add another statment to the Then box and choose <i>
Whisper back #1</i> from the pulldown menu. Type <i>You are now a member.</i>
 in the small textbox. This is a precautionary step to make sure you know
that the trigger was set off.   
<p>Click Update. Click Update again. Add another Action and name it <i>Remove 
 Member</i>. Change your If statement to look like the following: <i>If *
Whispers  me retire</i>. Now when anyone whispers the bot <i>retire</i> this
Action will be triggered. Now add a statment to the Then box. Choose <i>$LOG:
Remove record #1 from file #2</i> from the pulldown menu. Type <i>[player]</i>
 in the first textbox and type <i>members.txt</i> in the second textbox.
</p>
<p>Add yet another statement to the Then box and choose <i>Whisper back #1</i>
  from the pulldown menu. Type <i>You are no longer a member.</i> in the
small textbox. Click Update. Click Update again, then Close and Save your
bot! Now when anyone whispers <i>join</i> to your bot, and they are not already
a member, the bot will add their name to <i>members.txt</i>. When anyone
whispers your bot <i>retire</i>, and they are a member, the bot will remove
their name from <i>members.txt</i>.
