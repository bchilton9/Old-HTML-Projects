name the action with a name that tells you what the action does. Lets name
this one 'Greeting', without the quotes, because this action will be used to greet furres when they greet the bot.<br>

Click Update on the current window, click update on the Action window, then

      <p>About FurBot Variables:&nbsp;  </p>
      </td>
      <td valign="Top">All variables in FurBot are incased in brackets (The brackets are []).
The [player] variable holds the value of the whispering furres name and the
[message] variable holds the message that the whispering furre sent.  There are other variables that can split up the contents
of the message. They are as follows:<br>
      <br>
[startingword#] - All words after and including the # are held in this variable.
When used, replace the # with the number of the word you want to start with.<br>
      <blockquote>Ex: If * Does orders *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then Emote gives [player] [startingword2]<br>
        <br>
In this example, the bot stores everyword after the second word and the second
word in the variable [startingword2]. Then gives the triggering furre what
they ordered.<br>
        </blockquote>
[word#] - A specific word is held in this variable. When used, replace the
# with the number of the word you want to be stored in the variable.<br>
        <blockquote>Ex: If * Does orders * in a tall glass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Then Emote gives [player] [word2] in a tall glass.<br>
          <br>
In this example, the bot stores the second word in the [word2] variable.
Then gives the triggering furre what they ordered in a tall glass.<br>

          <p>[7]&nbsp; </p>
          </td>
          <td valign="Top">Back to the action. Click the Update button on the current window. Click
 the Update button on the next window, then click Close, and Save your bot.
 Now when anyone whispers your bot anything, your bot will whisper you the
 name of the furre that whispered it and what they whispered. <br>

          </td>
          <td valign="Top">Now that you know how to make an action, a Trigger will be easy to learn
 because Actions and Triggers are only different in one way and that thing
 is what they are triggered by. Actions are triggered by something a furre
 does and Triggers are triggered by something Furcadia does. <br>

          </td>
          <td valign="Top">Try making a trigger and have it respond to different things that Furcadia
 does, for instance, When it connects to Furcadia have it whisper 'Connected'
 to you. After you have experimented with Triggers you are ready to move
onto Timers. <br>

          <p>[10]&nbsp; </p>
          </td>
          <td valign="Top">Timers are exactly what they seem to be. They do certain things at specified
 intervals of time. You can have your bot say a certain message every 5 minutes 
or so. The only problem is that it is only done in seconds so if you want 
it to do something on an interval thats longer than a minute then you'll have
to convert the minutes to seconds. Just multiply the number of minutes you
want by 60. <br>

          </td>
          <td valign="Top">Filters can block out any text from showing on the bots screen, being
written to the log file, or just not being processed. This can be useful
if you have some furre that sets off the same trigger multiple times and
you want the bot to stop responding to it. <br>

          </td>
          <td valign="Top">Lastly, is Who Is Online Detection. You can change 
how often your bot checks to see who is on the map by going to File... Configuration. 
When the bot checks to see who is on the map is when the Who Is Online Detection 
triggers take place. It can respond to someone leaving the map, coming onto 
the map, or to someone staying on the map. <br>

          </td>
          <td valign="Top">An example of Who Is Online Detection: 'If * Comes to the map Whisper
Hello friend! to [player]'. With this trigger if anyone that is on the current 
players list that wasn't on it the last time the bot checked to see who is 
on the map will be whispered 'Hello friend!' by the bot.<br>
