<h3>
<p>Creating &amp; Connecting a bot  </p>
<p>Before using MUSHclient you'll need to create a character for Furcadia 
to use as the bot. If you plan on making bots with MUSHclient then you should 
already know how to do this.  </p>
<p>Once you have downloaded and opened MUSHclient go to the File menu and 
click New. When a message box pops up asking to "Preload world defaults from 
an existing world?" answer No. In the new window, type <i>Furcadia - YourBotsName</i>
 in the World Name textbox. In the TCP/IP address textbox you can type Furcadia's 
IP address or its "friendly name". In the port number textbox type Furcadia's 
port address. The IP and Port cannot be posted, so ask another botmaker for
them. Click on the Connecting tab.  In the Name textbox type your bots name
using shift+backslash for any spaces. In the Password textbox type your bots
password, the characters will show as asterisks so be careful when entering
your password. In the Connect Text textbox, type the following:   </p>
<p><i>connect %name% %password% <br>
 desc YourBotsDescription <br>
 color YourBotsColorCode&amp;SpeciesCode  </i></p>
<p>You can get your bots desc and color code from the ini file that was created 
when you created the character.    You can find a translation of specie codes 
on Mad Hatters bot site. Once you done this click OK and your bot will automatically 
connect. Don't be surprised to see a bunch of code constantly fly passed your
screen, thats normal. The first thing you need to do is get your bot to Allegria
so type <i>goalleg</i>. If you want to easily locate your bot in Allegria 
then type <i>use </i>to send it to the F3 spot then take yourself to that
spot as well.  </p>
