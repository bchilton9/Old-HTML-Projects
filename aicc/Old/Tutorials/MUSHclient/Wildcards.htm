<p>MUSHclient 102 - Wildcards  </p>
<p>Wildcards are symbols that represent a group of characters or a single 
character in your trigger.  The * represents a group of characters and the 
? represents a single character. The trigger that  will be made in this tutorial 
will be the *. We are going to make a simple bar bot. Click on the  Triggers 
button, then click Add. Type the following in the Trigger textbox:  </p>
<p>(* orders *  </p>
<p>When someone says, does, or whispers anything, an open parentheses is placed
at the beginning  of what they say, do, or whisper. The first * represents 
the Furres name and the second * represents  what the Furre ordered. With 
this trigger, the bot responds to anyone that orders something.  </p>
<p>Example: (Red|Dragon orders a root beer  </p>
<p>In the Send box, type the following:  </p>
<p><i>:gives %1 %2</i>  </p>
<p>%1 represents the first * in the Trigger textbox which in this case is 
the Furre's name. <br>
 %2 represents the second * which in this case is what the furre ordered.
  </p>
<p>So if Red|Dragon orders a root beer then what the bot sends would like 
the following:  </p>
<p>Example: BotName gives Red|Dragon a root beer  </p>
<p>Click OK and close the Triggers window. You now have your first trigger 
using wildcards!  </p>
