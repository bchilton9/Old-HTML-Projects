      There is going to be a Naked Man Tournament Held This Sunday March 16, 2003 at 7pm est. We are not quite sure on the time yet but, it will more then likely kick of after the officers meeting. The event is going to be held in West Freeport. All of the DoT members will be starting new human characters that MUST start in Freeport. You can chose whatever class best suits you. We will have the naked men (or women) battle in the arena as lvl 1 characters only equiping there 1. Newbie starting weapon, 2. There training tunic/robe, and 3. The spells that they have on them. You Will not be allowed to purchace any of there other lvl 1 spells or give them items from your other chars. Once we get winners from each of the class events, we will have an all out battle in the arena for fun. I hope to see you all there for some laughs! Prizes will be awarded by Senadien, Keny, and Myself.
