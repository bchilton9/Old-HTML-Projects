# Change the text in the messages to their appropriate equivalents.
# NOTE: messages MUST be in this format:
# msg_msgname: Message text
# Message text MUST be all on one line!!! You may use any HTML you wish.
# Certain variables are denoted by %VARIABLE% . Do NOT change these, but
# rather, translate the text around them, otherwise the debugging messages
# will be useless. If you have questions, please feel free to email me
# (http://www.tesol.net/scriptmail.html) and I will try to help, but please
# REMEMBER that I can only really support English versions. :-)
