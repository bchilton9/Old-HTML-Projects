Want a Better UI (Originally posted by Viciouss)|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|04/30/05 - 13:22:31|volizden|thumbup|68.92.120.228|I'm sure some of you know about this, but u should all check out: http://www.eq2interface.com They've got great interface pieces!! Also, the best thing I think, is the map project they're workin on. Get maps for everyzone (even tradeskill instance, lol) and little POI (points of interest) for certain things. Some might be npcs, some might be good hunting places, maybe some quest items r marked, and some entrances to dungeons and stuff. Plus, they have soooooo many of em by now that you can basically find everything by just looking around at the points, chances r, one of those marks wat ur looking for. Anyways, u should all check it out.<br> <br>got some pics of my UI (all of my pics are accidental, so sry if it's no perfect. I actually have never meant to take one, just keep hitting the button that takes pics). Some of em r from a few weeks ago, nothing recent, so these aren't my real lvls (since I know someone would end up asking).<br> <br>
