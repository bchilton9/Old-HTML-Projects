Re: Give Away 2|Viciouss|nboliviero@verizon.net|05/17/05 - 17:39:43|Viciouss|xx|71.97.12.99|ok, all i need from ur list is the weathered High elf and weathered gnoll bones. All i looked at was complete collections (i don't really worry about the &quot;gnoll bone collections&quot; and stuff even though i've started a few).<br><br>the ones I really want to get done is the Cracked Bones collection. I've been buying them off the broker recently but i'm not gonna pay a crap load for a stupid bone. I have like 4-5 left and they are all going for 5-10g+ usually, which is stupid cuz the cracked bone collection is low lvl and honestly not too good, but i still wanna finish it.<br><br>As for ants, i alrdy did it, and shards i only need Glowing shards (which are expensive and rare to come by at my lvl). I'm sure others will need things too though.
