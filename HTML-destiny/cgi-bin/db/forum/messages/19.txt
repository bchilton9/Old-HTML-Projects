The event went fairly smoothy and we did raise the guild 1.5 levels to a little over lvl 11.5. <br><br>Not all got done on the first day, we had to run a group through the following saturday. It was a good showing of guild support from most of our active members.<br><br>Great work all and keep it up.<br><br>Keep an eye on this forum for future events comming soon
