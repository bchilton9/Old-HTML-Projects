The Tree|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|04/28/05 - 14:07:45|volizden|xx|68.92.120.228|The Tree <br><br>It is hard to find a joke today without a dirty word or two in it, but, here is one: <br><br>Two tall trees, a birch and a beech, are growing in the woods. A small tree begins to grow between them, and the beech says to the birch, &quot;Is that a son of a beech or a son of a birch?&quot; <br><br>The birch says he cannot tell. Just then a woodpecker lands on the sapling. The birch says, &quot;Woodpecker, you are a tree expert. Can you tell if that is a son of a beech or a son of a birch?&quot; <br><br>The woodpecker takes a taste of the small tree. He replies, &quot;It is neither a son of a beech nor a son of a birch. It is, however, the best piece of ash I have ever put my pecker in.&quot; <br><br>Wipe that smile off your face.[lol][lol][lol][lol][lol]
