Attention Everyone!!!!|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|04/30/05 - 14:38:46|volizden|exclamation|68.92.120.228|[b]Original Post old Website Viciouss [/b]<br><br>I've found out today that I'm our new guild Event Planner since Abar left (thx to all you officers). This means that I'm going to need everyone's cooperation to get some events up and running. First, you need to visit my other thread and lists quests that you need to complete. Second, you need to answer the following questions in this thread. Third you need to visit the forums more often and keep an eye out for changes (many to come).<br> <br>Please answer the following so I can get a feel of your opinions:<br> <br>1. What time would you like to do quests? Keep in mind these are usually heritge/access quests and can easily take hours. Pleas generalize your answer, such as night, evening, mid afternoon, etc.<br> <br>2. Do you want to do quests as a whole (at one time) or split it up for more conveniance?<br> <br>3. How often do you want to do these quests? Obviously your answer to #2 is going to affect this. Basically, we can shoot for as little as once a month or as much as once every other week.<br> <br>Lastly, keep in mind all quests will be on weekends or maybe some on Friday nights.<br><br>Viciouss<br><br>[b](Response post Ehan)[/b]<br><br>Weekends are much better for me if I'm to take part in the events, at least that way I've got a chance of being able to make it. <br><br>I can try and slot in to whatever times suit the majority so if you're doing them on say a Saturday night I can get up early Sunday morning and join the rest of you. <br><br>Once a week if we can but if not once every two weeks as a minimum wherever possible.<br><br>[b](Response By Volizden)[/b]<br><br>1. Time see under Recruit forums for times<br><br>2. Whole part at a time, over a couple days dont matter, as long as we get back to finish them...<br><br>3. Once a week if possible<br><br>[b](Response by Ferrik)[/b]<br><br>First, Grats on the promotion to Event Planner, Viciouss!!!<br><br>1. &nbsp;Best times will probably be Thursday - Sunday in the evenings EST.<br><br>2. &nbsp;As a whole when possible so that we can do them as a guild, but Heritages and such may take several nights to complete.<br><br>3. Setting up a weekly time may be best. &nbsp;We won't always be able to achieve a good result, but at least we have a schedule to work from.<br><br>I'd suggest you pick a night and time that seems to work for the majority and adjust as needed after you establish a regular event schedule.<br><br>- Ferrik the Cleric <br><br>[b](Response by Game)[/b]<br><br>i'm game for any work on a heritage anytime im on.<br><br>sorry my hours are very, very random, and work is picking up so i will be on less and less as summer sets in.<br><br>
