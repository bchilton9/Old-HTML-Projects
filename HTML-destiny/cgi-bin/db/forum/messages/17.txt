Advantages of being NAKED|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|04/30/05 - 13:42:10|volizden|thumbup|68.92.120.228|[b](ORIGINAL POST Old Destiny Site -- By Calidan)[/b]<br><br>Haha, got you to look!  Anyway I'm gonna explain why you should craft naked (well, without any +power or +stat, stat being whatever stat your power pool is based off)<br>(BTW, for scouts its agility, and fighters, its power)<br> <br>So anyway, all crafters have a buff that uses power to increase progress or durability.  This reaction art, or buff, uses a predetermined % of your power pool.  So no matter how much power you have, it will always use that same %.  <br> <br>For example, lets say it uses 10% power, and I have 1200 power with gear on.  It'll use about 120 power.  Since 120 is 10% of 1200.  But lets say I remove my gear.  taking my power down to a smaller number, such as 700. Now its only gonna use 70, instead of 120.  <br> <br>Thats well and good, but if you aren't drinking to regen your power, its not gonna help.  Your base power regen is 4% of your total.  So the percentages stay the same without a drink of your lv.  But here's the trick.  Drinks dont add a % regen, they add a certain number, based on its lv.  So lets say I use a lv30 drink, that regens +54 power per tick (actual number) . <br> <br>So, With all my gear on, at 1200 power.  I'm using 120, and regenerating 102.  (4% of 1200 is 48, then add 54 for the drink).   <br> <br>But if I'm wearing nothing, so I have 700 power.  I use 70 power, I regen 84 (4% = 28, add 56 for drink)<br> <br>Note:  because of the way the timing works, you only get a regen burst(the moment when your regen hits every few seconds) as often as you'll use the power buff, if you use it constantly.  <br>Also Note:  If you are not the same lv, or higher than the drinks lv, you wont get the full regen. (see my other post about drink and food regen <br> <br>Hope this helps.  If you have a question, post it and i'll see if I can answer it.<br>-- Calidan Kaiaskitty <br><br>[b](Response by Viciouss)[/b]<br><br>will the dmg done be reduced? cuz that freakin forge hurts. anywhere from 400-700 dmg (usually in the high area) and if i take off all my armor, it might do more, plus i'll have less health. So is dmg done in percents? or numbers? <br><br>[b](Respnse by Volizden)[/b]<br><br>The Damage is reduced to reflect the percentage of your current hp as it is naked. <br><br>[b](Response By Game)[/b]<br>NICE!<br><br>[b](Response By Calidan)[/b]<br><br>Korth is the guy who explained it to me in the first place.<br>I dont suggest the 5 shards thing if you adventure, and if you try it anyhow, remember to take off your gear first, so as not to ruin it.<br> <br>Another note about this.  Those doing the jboots runs.  Remove your gear, get 5 shards and everything to lower your power pool.  I was able to sprint for 2 minutes flat before it wore off and was able to redo sprint by the time i was full power again.<br>-- Calidan Kaiaskitty <br><br>[b](Response From Ferrik)[/b]<br><br>Another lesson from Korth, lol?  I remember him complaining about having to hit sprint every couple minutes to refresh it since his power never ran out while sprinted around harvesting!  Oh, I ran into him the other day, and he wanted me to mention to the guild that he needs more tier 4 &amp; 5 harvesters for provisioner supplies.  Sounded like a good deal, so anyone interested should give him a tell.  He might even be interested in returning to Destiny (hint hint to the officers, lol). <br>- Ferrik the Cleric <br><br>[b](Response Calidan)[/b]<br><br>Actually, he didn't teach me that.  I never lost shards and lkeft them in the world on purpose, but when I realized sprint was % based also, i figured It was worth a try and I did that on an alt, and sprinted from QH, to NQ gate (in SQ) and  back before sprint had to be refreshed.  I lost a total of 15-20'ish % power.<br>-- Calidan Kaiaskitty <br><br>[b](Response Ferrik)[/b]<br><br>Nice discovery!  I wasn't trying to take away from your thread by mentioning Korth.  This is really good information and I'm glad you posted it for everyone. <br>- Ferrik the Cleric
