Police|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|04/28/05 - 14:07:00|volizden|xx|68.92.120.228|Good <br>An Erie, PA, policeman had a perfect spot to watch for speeders, but wasn't <br>getting many. Then he discovered the problem. A twelve year old boy was <br>standing up the road with a hand painted sign, which read &quot;RADAR TRAP <br>AHEAD&quot;. The officer then found a young accomplice down the road with a <br>sign reading &quot;TIPS&quot; and a bucket full of money. (And we used to just sell <br>lemonade!) <br><br>Better <br>A motorist was mailed a picture of his car speeding through an automated <br>radar post in Pittsburgh, PA. A $40 speeding ticket was included. Being <br>cute, he sent the police department a picture of $40. The police responded <br>with another mailed photo of handcuffs. <br><br>Absolute Best <br>A young woman was pulled over for speeding. As the Pennsylvania State <br>Trooper walked to her car window, flipping open his ticket book, she said &quot;I <br>bet you are going to sell me a ticket to the State Troopers Ball&quot;. <br>He replied, &quot;Pennsylvania State Troopers don't have balls&quot;. <br><br>There was a moment of silence while she smiled, and he realized what he'd <br>just said. He then closed his book, got back in his patrol car and left. She <br>was laughing too hard to start her car.[evil]
