The Rules|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|05/01/05 - 15:23:06|volizden|exclamation|4.152.39.91|1.  Our number one rule is to enjoy yourself, so [b]have fun![/b]<br><br>2. We do our best to get along with others.  As such, we expect all members to play nice with all others they may come across.   Here are a few ideas of what we mean by &quot;play nice&quot;<br> <br>Guild groups should always give item loot to whoever needs it, if more than one needs it, then have those who do, lotto for it. <br> <br>Do not steal loot from your groups. <br> <br>We encourage you to give guildmates a discount when selling items to another guildmate(we only encourage it, it is not required, nor will you be frowned upon for not doing so). <br> <br>If you have a problem with another person, including a guildmate, please do not argue in /ooc, /shout, /gsay, /guildsay, /auction, or any public channel.  Take it to tells because no one wants to see this.  If you cannot resolve the conflict on your own, please contact an officer to help mediate the situation.<br> <br> <br>3.  We understand things happen in the real world that affect our playing times, when something happens we would apreciate you letting us know that you may be gone awhile.   Any members inactive for 60 days, or more, without a notice will be removed.   Recruits inactive for 30 days, without notice, will be removed and must re-apply if they wish to join us.  Members who were removed for lack of notice may be reflagged as a recruit without a new apllication.<br> <br>4. We want you to understand, not everyone is as old as you are, and not everyone is comfortable with the same things you are, so be courteous in guildchat and keep in mind that very many different people play this game.<br> <br>5.  Often times we need the help of our fellow guild members, keep this in mind when people need your help.  Don't expect any help for yourself unless you help out also.<br> <br>6.  Remember that we are all real people.  As such we expect you to treat others as you'd like to be treated in return.
