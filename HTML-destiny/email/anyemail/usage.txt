                          AnyEmail setup is very simple, because it has only two
 Anyemail in              things to set in the script.
 Action
 [Image] Live                * Path to perl version 5.
 Demo                          By default, the first line of AnyEmail.cgi script
 [Image]                       is
 DownLoad                      #!/usr/bin/perl
 [Image]
                               You must replace it with the path to perl 5 on
                               your system , such as /usr/local/bin/perl., if it
                               is different from the default. Ask your system
                               administrator is in doubt.

                             * SMTP server name.
                               This is the server through which email is sent. By
                               default, it is localhost, which is the machine
                               where the CGI script is running. You may need to
                               change it to the SMTP server of your choice. If
                               your web server is www.yourname.com, the SMTP
                               server is usually yourname.com.
                             * Sendmail command
                               If you do not have access to a SMTP server, then
                               you can use the sendmail command. To tell AnyEmail
                               to use sendmail, you set the $use_sendmail to 1.
                               You may also need to change the $sendmail_cmd
                               according to

                             * $fix_cgi_url: if you are installing on an MS IIS
                               server, you must set the $fix_cgi_url to the full
                               url of the anyemail script. For example:
                               $fix_cgi_url="http://netbula.com/scripts/anyemail.plx";
                             * $icon_location
                               This is the URL of the directory where the image
                               icons are located. By default, this is
                               http://icon.anyboard.net, you should copy the
                               image icons to your web server and set this URL
                               accordingly.
                             * $anyemaildir
                               This is a diretory for storing optional data for
                               AnyEmail, such as mailing lists, log files,
                               configuration files, etc.

                          After the above changes, you must install AnyEmail as a
                          CGI script. How to do it depends on your web server.
                          Consult your web server's FAQ on this.

                          Optional POP3 settings

                          $fixed_pop_server
                               This is used to set a default POP3 server, when
                               this is set, user don't have to enter the full
                               email address. For example, if $fixed_pop_server
                               is set to netbula.com, to retrieve email for
                               support@netbula.com, one only need to enter
                               support in the login window.
                          $use_fixed_popserver_only
                               When this is set to 1, a user can only access
                               email from the POP3 server specified in the
                               $fixed_pop_server.
                          $non_changeable_from_address
                               When this is set to 1, the user can not change the
                               from address in the send message form.
                          $fixed_return_domain
                               If only user account is entered in the login
                               window, the return address is set to
                               userid@$fixed_return_domain. For example, if
                               $fixed_return_domain is set to netbula.com, and
                               $fixed_pop_server is set to pop3.netbula.com, and
                               user entered support in the login window, then
                               email is retrieved from pop3.netbula.com and
                               return address for outgoing email is set to
                               support@netbula.com.

                          %email_to_pop3_map
                               This variables allows you set a map to map email
                               domain address to POP3 servers, so user do not
                               have to enter the POP3 server name when the email
                               domain and POP3 address does not match.


                          Other settings

                               $broke_pathinfo
                               Some web servers (such as IIS) does not suppor the
                               PATHINFO, the result is a server error when user
                               trying to view attachments using AnyEmail. In this
                               case you should set $broke_pathinfo = 1;



                          [Image] AnyEmail Usage

                          Now, you can read and send email through AnyEmail.

                          Access email from your POP3 account

                          To read email, AnyEmail needs to login to the POP3
                          server with your userid and password and retrieve
                          messages. In most cases, the POP3 server's name is the
                          same as the domain name in your email address. For
                          example, for support@netbula.com, the user account is
                          support, and the POP3 server is netbula.com. To read
                          messages, simply enter the email address
                          (support@netbula.com) and the password into the login
                          form.

                          In the case when the POP3 server is different than the
                          domain name in the email address, enter the POP3 server
                          name after the email address, separated by a /. For
                          instance, suppose the POP3 server for
                          support@netbula.com is pop3.netbula.com, the Email
                          field should be entered as

                                   support@netbula.com->pop3.netbula.com

                          AnyEmail stores the email addresses you have accessed
                          on your computer, next time when you use AnyEmail, you
                          don't have to enter the address again, instead you can
                          select it from the addresses in the drop-down list on
                          the right hand side of the login screen. Once logged in
                          successfully, you will be brought to a page like this

                          [Anyemail main interface]
                          Click here for detail

                          The messages are listed in reverse order of the time
                          (with most recent ones on the top), clicking on a
                          header will sort the list based on the header field. To
                          read a message, simply click on the subject of the
                          message. Click on the sender address allows you to see
                          the full header of the message.

                          To delete messages, check on the boxes left to the
                          subjects, and then click on the X graphic, the checked
                          messages will be deleted immediately.

                          Send/forward/reply to email

                          The send email form looks like the following

                          [Send email form]
                          click here for detail

                          The meaning of the fields are obvious. To send an
                          attachment along with an email message, click the
                          Browse button and select a file to be attached.

                          When you are forwarding a message, the original message
                          is not included in the message box. AnyEmail knows you
                          are forwarding the message, it will get the message
                          from the POP3 server and send it directly to the SMTP
                          server.
