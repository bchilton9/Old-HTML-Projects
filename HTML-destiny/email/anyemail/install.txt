Basic installation steps for AnyEmail

1) ftp the aedata/ directory to your web server, change the permissions of aedata and its sub directories'
   permissions to make them writable by AnyEmail (0777 permission under UNIX/Linux). AnyEmail will complain
   about permissions if these directories are not writable.

   ftp the aeicons/ directory to your web root (where your main home page sits), the url of aeicons/ should be
   http://your-site-name.com/aeicons/

2) Edit the anyemail.cgi script

   a) If needed, edit the first line #!/usr/bin/perl to reflect PERL locaton on your server.

   b) Set $fix_cgi_url to the URL of the anyemail.cgi script, for example

               $fix_cgi_url = "http://perlpro.com/cgi-bin/anyemail.cgi";

   c) Set $anyemaildir to the full path of the aedata/ directory just uploaded, for example

               $anyemaildir = "C:/anyemail/aedata"; 

      You can use relative path (relative to your CGI-BIN) if you are not sure about the full path.

      note: we use / as directory separator even for Windows system

   d) Set $icon_location to the URL of the DIRECTORY aeicons/, for example,

	$icon_location = 'http://your-domain.com/aeicons';

3) Upload the anyemail.cgi (change extension from cgi to pl if needed)  to your /cgi-bin/
