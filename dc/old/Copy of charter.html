	  ==============================================
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Defenders of the Rose - Charter
	  <P>
	  Our Philosophy: (Inspired by the SoR)
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  The Defenders of the Rose was started to answer the call by many friends
	  of the Sisterhood of Roses who wanted to be part of the Roses' family. We
	  are a guild that defends and champions the same ideals and values that make
	  the Roses so respected in all of Norrath. We are fellow Roses.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  We believe in building and nurturing a world where respect and fair play
	  are paramount, where sharing, honor, trust and friendship are more important
	  than loot, or life itself. We are not an "uber" guild, nor are we braggarts.
	  We are a beacon of light for all that is good in Norrath.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  We honor the Sisterhood of Roses with our membership and champion their great
	  cause, helping fellow Roses and others truly in need. Strong in our memories
	  are the times when we were saved by a passing stranger and the sense of good
	  will it left on our souls and in our hearts.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  We have several core strengths. They define us as individuals and differentiate
	  us from ALL other guilds in Norrath. First is our sense of Honor and Duty.
	  Second is our friendship with the Sisterhood of Roses. Lastly is our respect
	  and unerring support for fellow Roses and others. The name of the Rose is
	  synonymous with trust to all who see, hear or speak it.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Our strength as a group grows from our connection as friends and sharing
	  similar ambitions as a guild. Our guild chat is what keeps us connected across
	  Norrath. It is our lifeline to each other and the perfect place for sharing
	  our adventures and comic relief.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  In the end, we are all here to have fun, entertain each other and put the
	  outside world on pause for some short time. We must always remember not to
	  take ourselves too seriously and continue to make this a fun place for us
	  all.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Joining our ranks:
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  The requirements to joining the Defenders, are dependant upon the level of
	  the applicant, which until membership is granted will be know as a pledge.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  The basic requirements for membership are as follows:
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Character must be level 10 or greater
	  <P>
	  Character cannot be a Shadowknight, Necromancer, Troll, Ogre, Iksar, or Dark
	  Elf
	  <P>
	  Character must complete the Heritage quest
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Upon receiving an invitation, the pledge will be considered on quest status.
	  The pledge will remain on quest status until all of his basic membership
	  requirements are met. This enables the pledge to interact with other members,
	  and get to know them while working toward full membership. Obtaining assistance
	  from other members to complete membership requirements is encouraged, however
	  not required. 
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Membership Guidelines:
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Our reputation in Norrath is one of our most important issues. Since we are
	  affiliated with the Sisterhood, they are certainly judged by our actions.
	  Protecting their reputation outweighs all else.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  The do's:
	  <P>
	  Help and greet other brother and sister Roses often.
	  <P>
	  Be active in guild chat.
	  <P>
	  Be respectful and courteous to others, especially other Roses and officers.
	  <P>
	  Share your knowledge and experience whenever possible.
	  <P>
	  Share loot equitably in your groups.
	  <P>
	  Always strive to be fair in your dealings with others
	  <P>
	  Be positive and patient.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  The don'ts:
	  <P>
	  No ninja or power looting.
	  <P>
	  No rude, negative, abusive, insulting or irritating language or behavior.
	  <P>
	  No spaming in any channels.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Legitimate complaints regarding any of the don'ts can get one expelled from
	  the Defenders by a vote of the officers.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Officers and Promotion Guidelines:
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  Officers are superior Defenders that have demonstrated a commitment to the
	  guild and the game through time and action. They are charged with conducting
	  the business of the guild while modeling the most respectable conduct and
	  game play. They are further charged with building strong membership and
	  camaraderie. They are also ambassadors and represent the guild in relations
	  with other guilds, adventurers and GM's in Norrath.
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  When it comes time to add officers, all members may nominate fellow Roses
	  they feel worthy of the role. After someone has received 2 nominations, the
	  officers will discuss the nominees in a closed forum. With the approval of
	  3 or more officers, the nominee will be promoted.*
	  <P>
	  <P>
	  As a guideline, we will strive for 2 officers for every 10 unique members
	  in the guild.
