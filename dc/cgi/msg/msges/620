I did not know all this would happen from the points page i did put on the top of the page that it was not offichel yet
the point system is not to discurage or piss anyone off it is a reward system
you help out by doing something for/with the guild you get something in return
you go to a raid you get points you take your points and spend them on items for your char

the system i came up with is ment to be fair
for example
Lil gos on a raid to a lvl 50 zone  he gets 50 points (zone lvl of 50 divited by zone rateing of 1 = 50)

the next raid an item drops that he wants he may bit points on the item and if he is the highest bidder he gets the item i take the points off his card

points may also be given as prizes example the turky hunt all the people who get all 10 turkeys would get X number of points

if we have a tuornament, race ect.. points may be gives at prizes
example
first place on the naked gnome race is 100points
2nd 50points
3rd 25points
10 points for all that attend

problems with the roll for loot is
Klassy never shows up for a raid
Keny is at every raid ever held
klassy rolls a random number and comes up with 89
keny rolls a random number and comes up with 6
klassy gets the item even tho this is the first raid shes been on and keny gets screwed

problems with the master list
(im goina use keny and klassy agine)
keny has been in the guild from day one but never attends a raid
klassy joined 4 months after but goes to all the raids
keny decides to go to a raid and item comes up
keny gets it because hes higher on the list then klassy even tho he hasent gone to any raids
klassy gets screwed

i am willing to rewrite this point system 100 times if thats what it takes but i think to be fair to the members that have been more active in the guild we need it
