      Dark circles was established to be a mid to high level adventuring guild that is dedicated to helping its members obtain all that they seek in the world of Norrath. We accept all races, classes and genders.  We are a family based guild that plays the game for the fun and enjoyment that it was intended. Our family of members comes first for us  we are there for our fellow members whenever they call. Because of our goal to help our members obtain the high end game, we have established a level limit of 35 for new members. Alts of guilded characters are accepted at any level and we will do our best to help those alts to achieve the level limit as quickly as possible. As in all things exceptions can be made to characters that have displayed exemplary game skills or act in a manner that stands out. These exceptions can only be made at the request of a standing guild member and must be approved by the guild leader and a minimum of two other officers.

      Our members are expected to follow the rules of good game play at all times. We expect them to conduct themselves with honor and respect at all times. Please keep in mind that while wearing our guild tag your behavior reflects on all members of Dark Circles. No rude vulgar or profane language will be tolerated in guild chat or in open chat modes at any time ( these include /say, /shout, /ooc). We also ask that our members never engage in Kill Stealing, Ninja Looting or Camp Stealing at any time. Above all have fun and treat others the way that you would like to be treated.

      Dark Circles is dedicated to helping its members reach the high-end goals in the game, which includes epic quests and dragon slaying. To that end it is essential that we raid as a guild as often as possible so that we can become accustomed to working as a unit. Our officers and raid committee will attempt to schedule at least two raids per month of various levels. Attendance at all guild raids is expected if you are online and meet the minimum level requirements of that raid. The success of any guild raid is dependant on the participation of all. Because all are vital to that success, the raid leader will contact any level appropriate player that is online but not in attendance to find out the reason they are not there. Consistent nonparticipation in guild functions including raids could result in disciplinary action. If you want to be a part of our family you will want to participate in the things that make it successful. We are developing a system of rewards for raid participation and loot distribution… when this is completed we will post it here.
      <P>
      Finally we want to impress upon all members that this is your guild and your family here in Norrath. As with all families disputes will occur and are expected. We ask that if any member has a problem that they bring it to an officer and allow the officers to address those issues. We value the input of all of our members and will take it into account in our decision-making processes. Please go forth into the land of Norrath and wear your Dark Circles tag with pride. Have fun and be safe.
