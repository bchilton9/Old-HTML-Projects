that page is a little complex i was hopeing to keep it simple
i was thinking of changeing how points are given from zone lvl /5 to
rateing the sone and/or mob like 1 to 5 with 5 being low lvl zones

example
cb ruffly lvl 15 zone
rateing 5
lvl 15 / 5 = 3 points
poa ruffly lvl 50 zone (never been there not shure exalty what lvl it is)
rateing of 1
lvl 50 / 1 = 50 points

and the same with spending points
1 to 5 with 5 being high lvl zones
cb
lvl 15 * 1 = 15 points for an item
poa
lvl 50 * 5 = 250 points for an item

rateing dosent meen lvl
tofs can be taken very easy
lvl 30 to 50 i think take an avrage of 40
rate it at 2
80 points per item
20 points for going

we may need to work on the numbers a bit

we will also keep with the need befor greed
if a good druid item is 200 points and the druid that needs it has 100 points but
theres a wizard with 200 points that wants the item for selling it will be
considered and most likly go to the druid inless there is a reason for it not too
