And Joseph went up from Galilee to Bethlehem with Mary, his espoused wife,<BR> 
who was great with child. And she brought forth a son and wrapped him in <BR>
swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for <BR>
them in the inn. And the angel of the Lord spoke to the shepherds and said, <BR>
"I bring you tidings of great joy. Unto you is born a Saviour, which is <BR>
Christ the Lord." <BR>

"There's a problem with the angel," said a Pharisee who happened to be <BR>
strolling by. As he explained to Joseph, angels are widely regarded as <BR>
religious symbols, and the stable was on public property where such symbols<BR> 
were not allowed to land or even hover. <BR>

"And I have to tell you, this whole thing looks to me very much like a <BR>
Nativity scene," he said sadly. "That's a no-no, too." <BR>
Joseph had a bright idea. "What if I put a couple of reindeer over<BR> 
there near the ox and ass?" he said, eager to avoid sectarian strife. <BR>

"That would definitely help," said the Pharisee, who knew as well as anyone<BR> 
that whenever a saviour appeared, judges usually liked to be on the safe <BR>
side <BR>
and surround it with deer or woodland creatures of some sort. "Just to <BR>
clinch it, throw in a candy cane and a couple of elves and snowmen, too," he<BR> 
said. "No court can resist that." <BR>

Mary asked, "What does my son's birth have to do with snowmen?" <BR>

"Snowpersons," cried a young woman, changing the subject before it veered<BR> 
dangerously toward religion. Off to the side of the crowd, a Philistine was <BR>
painting the Nativity scene. Mary complained that she and Joseph looked too <BR>
tattered and worn in the picture. "Artistic license," he said. "I've got <BR>
to show the plight of the haggard homeless in a greedy, uncaring society in <BR>
winter," he quipped. <BR>

"We're not haggard or homeless. The inn was just full," said Mary. <BR>
"Whatever," said the painter. <BR>

Two women began to argue fiercely. One said she objected to Jesus' birth <BR>
"because it privileged motherhood." The other scoffed at virgin births, but <BR>
said that if they encouraged more attention to diversity in family forms and <BR>
the rights of single mothers, well, then, she was all for them. "I'm not a <BR>
single mother," Mary started to say, but she was cut off by a third woman <BR>
who insisted that swaddling clothes are a form of child abuse, since they <BR>
restrict the natural movement of babies. <BR>

With the arrival of 10 child advocates, all trained to spot infant abuse and <BR>
manger rash, Mary and Joseph were pushed to the edge of the crowd, where <BR>
arguments were breaking out over how many reindeer (or what mix of reindeer <BR>
and seasonal sprites) had to be installed to compensate for the infant's <BR>
unfortunate religious character. <BR>

An older man bustled up, bowling over two merchants, who had been busy <BR>
debating whether an elf is the same as a fairy and whether the elf/fairy <BR>
should be shaking hands with Jesus in the crib or merely standing to the <BR>
side, jumping around like a sports mascot. <BR>

"I'd hold off on the reindeer," the man said, explaining that the use of <BR>
asses and oxen as picturesque backdrops for Nativity scenes carries the <BR>
subliminal message of human dominance. He passed out two leaflets, one <BR>
denouncing manger births as invasions of animal space, the other arguing <BR>
that stables are "penned environments" where animals are incarcerated <BR>
against their will. He had no opinion about elves or candy canes. <BR>

Signs declaring "Free the Bethlehem 2" began to appear, referring to the <BR>
obviously exploited ass and ox. Someone said the halo on Jesus' head was <BR>
elitist. Mary was exasperated. "And what about you, old mother?" she said <BR>
sharply to an elderly woman. "Are you here to attack the shepherds as <BR>
prison guards for excluded species, maybe to complain that singing in Latin<BR> 
identifies us with our Roman oppressors, or just to say that I should have <BR>
skipped patriarchal religiosity and joined some dumb new-age goddess <BR>
religion?" <BR>

"None of the above," said the woman, "I just wanted to tell you that the <BR>
Magi are here." Sure enough, the three wise men rode up. The crowd gasped, <BR>
"They're all male!" And "Not very multi cultural!" <BR>
"Balthasar here is black," said one of the Magi. <BR>
"Yes, but how many of you are gay or disabled?" someone shouted. <BR>
A committee was quickly formed to find an impoverished lesbian wise-person <BR>
among the halt and lame of Bethlehem. <BR>

A calm voice said, "Be of good cheer, Mary, you have done well and your son <BR>
will change the world." At last, a sane person, Mary thought. She turned <BR>
to see a radiant and confident female face. The woman spoke again: "There <BR>
is one thing, though. Religious holidays are important, but can't we learn <BR>
to celebrate them in ways that unite, not divide? For instance, instead of <BR>
all this business about 'Gloria in excelsis Deo,' why not just 'Season's <BR>
Greetings'?" <BR>

Mary said, "You mean my son has entered human history to deliver the <BR>
message, 'Hello, it's winter'?" <BR>
"That's harsh, Mary," said the woman. "Remember, your son could make <BR>
it big in midwinter festivals, if he doesn't push the religion thing <BR>
too far. Centuries from now, in nations yet unborn, people will give <BR>
each other pricey gifts and have big office parties on his birthday. <BR>
That's not chopped liver."
