      <TD><A NAME="make">What can I use to make my bot?</A></TD>
      <TD>There are many different programs you can use to make bots. The best
	place to start is Furcadia Bot Maker or FurBot then once you have become
	familiar with them you could move onto ZMud, MudMaster, or MUSHclient. If
	you are willing and able to spend a nice chunk of change you can buy Microsoft
	Visual Studio and make your bots with Visual Basic or Visual C++.</TD>

    <TR>
      <TD><A NAME="Where">Where are bots allowed?</A></TD>
      <TD>When you connect a bot to Furcadia it may be sent to a random main map.
	If this does happen move it to Allegria or a dream immediately(Preferably
	your dream). Bots are only allowed on Allegria Island and dreams. If a bot
	is caught on any other main map then it may get kicked and/or banned from
	Furcadia.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD><A NAME="do">What can I do with my bot?</A></TD>
      <TD>All rules that apply to furres in Furcadia apply to bots as well. Bots
	should not be used to annoy or insult anyone for any reason. If a bot is
	caught annoying or insulting anyone, the bot and its owner may be kicked
	and/or banned from Furcadia. If you are unsure it is annoying then DO NOT
	DO IT. Specifically, do not flood, spam, or use your bot to keep your dream
	up. That is not their purpose. Read more at Talzhemir's Treasure Trove.</TD>

    <TR>
      <TD><A NAME="ip">Can you give me the IP and Port address to Furcadia?</A></TD>
      <TD>Unfortunately, no, I cannot give you the IP and Port address for Furcadia.
	Try asking a botmaker in Furcadia.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD><A NAME="How">How do I... ?</A></TD>
      <TD> There are many things a bot can do and there they could not possibly
	be explained in this FAQ but you can find numerous tutorials on this site,
	on sites linked to this site, or ask a member of the AICC to help you. Also,
	to give credit to the creators of the program you are using you could put
	what you are using in your bot's descriptions such as putting "[FurBot]"
	at the end of your bot's description if you are using FurBot. </TD>
