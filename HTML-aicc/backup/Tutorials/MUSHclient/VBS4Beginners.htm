<p>MUSHclient 103 - VBScripting for Beginners</p>
<p>VBScript is a scripting language that allows a user to make more advanced
bots with MUSHclient.<br>
  </p>
<p>Create a new trigger and type <i>([ * whispers, "*" to you. ]</i> in the
Trigger textbox. Type "Whisper" in the Label textbox and in the Script textbox.
Click OK and close the Triggers box. Click on the Script button. Check the
Enable Script checkbox and click on the Edit Script button. A blank document
will open in Notepad. Save it as <i>Furc.vbs</i>, vbs is the file format
for VBScript files.   </p>
<p>In VBScript, routines accessed by MUSHclient when triggers are activated
are called Subs. We need to create a Whisper Sub for the trigger to access
that we created earlier. The following is the Whisper Sub with comment lines(lines
starting with an apostrophe), explaining each part of the Sub:  </p>
<p>'Sub means a sub routine is being declared with the name of the word following 
it, and some arguments in parentheses. The name of this Sub is Whisper and 
it has the arguments a, b, and c.  <br>
 'The 'a' argument holds the name of the label of the Trigger <br>
 'The 'b' argument holds the match text to the trigger pattern <br>
 'The 'c' argument is an array that holds each * placed in the trigger pattern
  </p>
<p>Sub Whisper(a,b,c) <br>
 'The first * in the trigger pattern is in place of the whispering furres 
name, so Furre will store c(1) <br>
 Furre = c(1) <br>
 'The second * in the trigger pattern holds the message from the whispering 
furre, so Msg will store c(2) <br>
 Msg = c(2) <br>
 'We'll have the bot send a message to the whispering furre, telling them 
who whispered the bot and what 'their message was, to verify that the script 
works. <br>
 'world.send means the text following it will be sent to Furcadia. Text strings 
should always be placed inside 'quotations. <br>
 'To insert a variable into the string you have to close the quotations,
use an ampersand (&amp;) to join the string 'and the variable together then
insert the variable, join the next part of the string with an ampersand and
'reopen the quotations to continue the string. The Chr(34) is used to insert
quotation marks within the string when its sent to Furcadia. In this case,
its used to put Msg inside of quotations. <br>
 world.send "wh " &amp; Furre &amp; " " &amp; Furre &amp; " has whispered 
" &amp; Msg &amp; " to me." <br>
 'After you are done with the Sub you close it with End Sub <br>
 End Sub  </p>
<p>So the Sub without comment lines would look like the following:  </p>
<p>Sub Whisper(a,b,c) <br>
 Furre = c(1) <br>
 Msg = c(2) <br>
 world.send "wh " &amp; Furre &amp; " " &amp; Furre &amp; " has whispered 
" &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Msg &amp; Chr(34) &amp; " to me." <br>
 End Sub  </p>
<p>You can leave the comment lines in the script for reference if you want, 
but they aren't necessary. Save the script and MUSHclient will ask you if 
you want to reload the script. Click Yes. This will load the script you just 
saved into MUSHclient so it can be used. Try whispering your bot and see what
happens. :) </p>
