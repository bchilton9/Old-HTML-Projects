<h1><u><b>Signs</b></u></h1><br>

</div>
In this tutorial you will learn how to make signs work in your dream. The 
first trigger you'll need is the 'Show DS' which is explained is <a href="DSresponse.htm">
DS Responses</a>
. You'll also need the following DS: <i>When somebody moves into position
(#,#), play sound # to everyone on the map.</i> The (#,#) is the position of the sign that will be bumped. This is the DS that the bot
responds to when a furre bumps a sign.  
<p>The position coordinates are the position of the sign and the sound # can
be any number of your choice (can be above 80). Be sure to use a different 
sound for each sign. Now once you have the DS setup and the bot in the dream, 
bump the sign. Something like the following should appear on your screen.
 </p>
<p><i>DS: dx: # dy: # dx2: # dy2: # did: # didx: # didy: #</i>. Now make
a trigger  that responds to this DS. Name it LookSign1. Choose <i>DS-trigger
# is sent</i>  from the pulldown menu in the When statement. Now Click the
Add button under the -And- box. Choose <i>variable # is # (numeric comparison)</i>
 from the pulldown menu. </p>
<p>Type <i>[dsx2]</i> in the first textbox and the number that appears after
<i>dx2:&nbsp;</i> when a furre bumps the sign in the second textbox. This
is the X coordinate  of the trigger. Click Update the Add another And statement.
And again choose <i>variable # is # (numeric comparison)</i> except this
time type <i>[dsy2]</i> in the first textbox and the number that appears
after <i>dy2:&nbsp;</i> when a furre bumps the sign in the second textbox.
This is the Y coordinate of the trigger. Click Update. </p>
<p>Now add a statement to the Then box. Choose <i>Store #1 to variable #1</i>
 from the pulldown menu. Type <i>1</i> in the first textbox and type <i>[signNum]</i>
 in the second textbox. Click Update. Add another statement to the Then box. 
Choose <i>Look furre who is at (#1,#2) and set [desc] and [color] to contain 
their stats</i> from the pulldown menu. In the first textbox type <i>[dsidx]</i>
 and type <i>[dsidy]</i> in the second textbox. This tells the bot to look
at the furre who bumped the sign, then put their desc, color, and name in
variables for later use. Click Update. Now you have finished the -first-
trigger for a sign. (Don't worry there are only two.) </p>
<p>Add a Trigger and name it <i>Sign1Msg</i>. Choose <i>Desc and color trigger
is activated</i> from the pulldown menu in the When statement then add a
statement to the And box. Choose <i>variable # is # (numeric comparison)</i>
 from the pulldown menu. Type <i>[signNum]</i> in the first textbox and <i>
1</i> in the second textbox. Click Update. Add a statement to the Then box.
Choose <i>Add text #1 to the connection log</i> from the pulldown menu and
type <i>DESC: [descname]</i> in the small textbox. This says if a furre bumps
sign 1 then show their name in the Connection Log. Click Update. </p>
<p>Add another statement to the Then box. Choose <i>Whisper #1 to #2</i>
from the pulldown menu. Type <i>Sign 1 Detected</i> in the first textbox
and type <i>[descname]</i> in the first textbox. Click Update. Add yet another
statement to the Then box (Last one =P). Choose <i>Store #1 to variable #2</i>
 from the pulldown menu. Type <i>-1</i> in the first textbox and type <i>
[signNum]</i> in the second textbox. Click Update. Click Update again. Click
Close. Save your bot. </p>
<p>Now when anyfurre bumps the sign the bot -should- whisper 'Sign 1 Detected'
 to the triggering furre. Here's a summary of what sign triggers do. When
someone sets off a DS trigger the bot checks the coordinates of the trigger.
If they are the chosen coordinates then the bot stores the sign value to
the variable [signNum] (In this case the value is 1) and looks at the position
that the triggering furre is standing at. Then when the desc and color stats
are recorded it checks the value of the [signNum] variable. If it is the
chosen value then it shows the triggering furres name in the connection log,
whispers the furre the sign message, and returns the value of [signNum] to
0. </p>
