Moonlight Ride
<P ALIGN=Center>
<P ALIGN=Center>
Jenny was so happy about the house they had found. For once in her life 'twas
on the right side of town. She unpacked her things with such great ease As
she watched her new curtains blow in the breeze. How wonderful it was to
have her own room. School would be starting, she'd have friends over soon.
There'd be sleep-overs, and parties; she was so happy It's just the way she
wanted her life to be. On the first day of school, everything went great.
She made new friends and even got a date! She thought, "I want to be popular
and I'm going to be, Because I just got a date with the star of the team!"
To be known in this school you had to have clout, And dating this guy would
sure help her out. There was only one problem stopping her fate. Her parents
had said she was too young to date. "Well, I just won't tell them the entire
truth. They won't know the difference; what's there to lose?" Jenny asked
to stay with her friends that night. Excited, she got ready for the big event
But as she rushed around like she had no sense, She began to feel guilty
about all the lies, But what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride? Well
the pizza was good, and the party was great, But the moonlight ride would
have to wait. For Jeff was half drunk by this time. But he kissed her and
said that he was just fine. Then the room filled with smoke and Jeff took
a puff. Jenny couldn't believe he was smoking that stuff. Now Jeff was ready
to ride to the point But only after he'd smoked another joint. They jumped
in the car for the moonlight ride, Not thinking that he was too drunk to
drive. They finally made it to the point at last, And Jeff started trying
to make a pass. A pass is not what Jenny wanted at all (and by a pass, I
don't mean playing football). "Perhaps my parents were right....maybe I am
too young. Boy, how could I ever, ever be so dumb." With all of her might,
she pushed Jeff away: "Please take me home, I dont want to stay." Jeff cranked
up the engine and floored the gas. In a matter of seconds they were going
too fast. As Jeff drove on in a fit of wild anger, Jenny knew that her life
was in danger. She begged and pleaded for him to slow down, But he just got
faster as they neared the town. "Just let me get home! I'll confess that
I lied. I really went out for a moonlight ride." Then all of a sudden, she
saw a big flash. "Oh God, Please help us! We're going to crash!" She doesn't
remember the force of impact Just that everything all of a sudden went black.
She felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble, And heard, "Call an
ambulance! These kids are in trouble!" Voices she heard...a few words at
best. But she knew there were two cars involved in the wreck. Then wondered
to herself if Jeff was all right, And if the people in the other car were
alive. She awoke in the hospital to faces so sad. "You've been in a wreck
and it looks pretty bad." These voices echoed inside her head, As they gently
told her that Jeff was dead. They said "Jenny, we've done all we can do.
But it looks as if we'll lose you too." "But the people in the other car!?"
Jenny cried. "We're sorry, Jenny, they also died." Jenny prayed, "God, forgive
me for what I've done I only wanted to have just one night of fun." "Tell
those people's family, I've made their lives dim, And wish I could return
their families to them." "Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied, And that it's
my fault so many have died. Oh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for
me?" The nurse just stood there ~ she never agreed. But took Jenny's hand
with tears in her eyes And a few moments later Jenny died. A man asked the
nurse, "Why didn't you do your best To bid that girl her one last request?"
She looked at the man with eyes oh so sad. "Because the people in the other
car were her mom and dad."

Close to the door
<P ALIGN=Center>
he paused to stand
<P ALIGN=Center>
as he took his class ring off her hand
<P ALIGN=Center>
all who were watching
<P ALIGN=Center>
did not speak
<P ALIGN=Center>
as a silent tear
<P ALIGN=Center>
ran down his cheek
<P ALIGN=Center>
and through his mind
<P ALIGN=Center>
the memories ran
<P ALIGN=Center>
of the moments they walked
<P ALIGN=Center>
and laughed in the sand
<P ALIGN=Center>
but now her eyes were so
<P ALIGN=Center>
terrible cold
<P ALIGN=Center>
for he would never again
<P ALIGN=Center>
have her to hold
<P ALIGN=Center>
they watched in silence
<P ALIGN=Center>
as he bent near
<P ALIGN=Center>
and whispered the words......
<P ALIGN=Center>
"I LOVE YOU" in her ear
<P ALIGN=Center>
he touched her face and started to cry
<P ALIGN=Center>
as he put on his ring and wanted to die
<P ALIGN=Center>
and just then the wind began to blow
<P ALIGN=Center>
as they lowered her casket
<P ALIGN=Center>
into the snow......
<P ALIGN=Center>
this is what happens
<P ALIGN=Center>
to man alive......
<P ALIGN=Center>
......when friends let friends......
<P ALIGN=Center>
drink and drive.
