<<  Things girls think guys should know

      1. Don't ever lie to us, we always find out.
      2. We don't enjoy talking dirty to you as much as you enjoy
 listening.
      3. Don't say you understand when you don't.
      4. Girls are petty, get over it.
      5. You don't have PMS; don't act like you know what it's like.
      6. Saying something sweet might get you off the hook; doing
 something
          sweet will always get you off the hook.
      9. We don't like it when you act like Mr Big; we like it when you
 are Mr. Big.
      10. A system in your car only impresses your homeboys.
      11. No matter what you say, your ex girlfriend is bad.
      12. It's good to be sensitive, sometimes.
      13. If you did something wrong or even if you didn't, apologize.
      14. Be spontaneous, dinner and a movie won't always cut it.
      15. We are self-conscious by nature, we can't help it.
      16. We are drama queens.
      17. Fashion police do exist.
      18. Don't ask us to give head; if you are nice you just might get
 it.
      19. We absolutely do not care about monster trucks, car systems,
             paintball or anything else you and your friends talk about.
      20. Hugs and kisses must be given at all times.
      21. We don't shave our legs every day, get over it.
      22. Don't make bets about us, we always find out.
      23. Shave- no matter how cool you think it looks, we hate it.
      24. Even is you think it is cool to burp, fart, or emitt other
 strange
 gases from your body, it is not.
      25. Don't compare our breasts with Pamela Anderson's, hers are fake.
      26. It is not cool to shoot snot rockets.
      27. We are beautiful, but make-up helps.
      28. We will always think we are fat so humor us and tell us we
 aren't.
      29. You can shoot hoops, score a goal, knock down big fat guys, and
 hit a little baseball with          a stick so why can't you pee in the
 toilet and not on it.  (and hit a little bulls-eye...)
      30. Most importantly- we are always right- so don't forget it. >>

           Everday I give thanks to the Goddess
         I have two mounds upon my bodice
       I shave my legs, I sit down to pee
    I can justify any shopping spree
         Not to a barber, but a beauty salon
            Can get a massage without a hard on
              Can balance the checkbook, pump my own gas
             Can talk to my friends about the size of my ass
            I always save money by using coupons
            Can admit to others when I am wrong
      Don't drive in circles at any cost
         So I don't have to admit when I am lost
        Don't act like I'm in a timed marathon
     Every time I go to the john
   Let me tell you men
   Listen to me boys
      Those things in your pants
      That you treat as toys
       You love them more then we ever will
       We would rather suck on a cold pickled dill
      I spend two hours preparing for a date
   Only to find you're two hours late
     I don't watch movies with lots of gore
            Don't need instant replay to remember the score
     I won't lose my hair
      I don't get jock itch
       And just cause I'm assertive
        Don't call me a bitch
          I don't wear the same underwear everyday
              The food in my fridge has no sign of decay
        I don't go to Sears
        To look at the tools
       I don't cheat at poker
        I follow the rules
       I don't smoke cigars
      Don't pay for drinks at bars
              I don't punch my friends just to say "Hi"
       And it's o.k. for me to cry
       I know all you men
      Think that you're "IT"
      But compared to a woman
     You just ain't SHIT!
 


<<  Adam and Eve

    In the Garden of Eden,
    As everyone knows,
    Lives Adam and Eve,
    Without any clothes.

    In this garden,
    Were two little leaves,
    One covered Adam's,
    One covered Eve's.

    As the story goes on,
    Never the less to say,
    The wind came along,
    And blew the leaves away.

    At the sight,
    Adam did stare,
    There was Eve's treasure,
    All covered with hair.

    And wonder came,
    Under Eve's eyes,
    As Adam's thing,
    Started to rise.

    They found a spot,
    That suited them best,
    A nice big tree,
    Where they began to rest.

    Her legs spread wider,
    And wider apart,
    While thrill after thrill,
    Came into her heart.

    The head of Adam's thing,
    Peeked into the hole,
    And filled her with passion,
    Beyond her control.

    Backward and forward,
    His thing did slide,
    And Eve's treasure,
    Was all wet inside.

    The joy was good,
    She wouldn't let loose,
    Until Adam's thing,
    Was all out of juice.

    Then down through the years,
    People did screw,
    And now it is time,
    For me and you.

    So pull down your pants,
    And lay in the grass,
    Cause I'm in the mood,
    For a piece of that ASS!

            THE CREATION OF A PUSSY

           Seven wise men with knowledge so fine,
           created a pussy to their design.
           First was a butcher,
           with smart wit,
           using a knife,
           he gave it a slit,
           Second was a carpenter,
           strong and bold,
           with a hammer and chisel,
           he gave it a hole,
           Third was a tailor,
           tall and thin,
           by using red velvet,
           the lined it within,
           Fourth was a hunter,
           short and stout,
           with a piece of fox fur,
           he lined it without,
           Fifth was a fisherman,
           nasty as hell,
           threw in a fish and gave it a smell,
           Sixth was a preacher,
           whose name was McGee,
           touched it and blessed it,
           and said it could pee,
           Last was a sailor,
           dirty little runt,
           he sucked it and fucked it,
           and called it a cunt.

           TOP TEN REASONS WHY TRICK OR TREATING IS BETTER THAN SEX

                10) You are guaranteed to get at least a little something in
              the sack.
                9) If you get tired, you can wait 10 minutes and go at it
          again.
                8) The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.
                7) You don't have to compliment the person who gives you
          some.
                6) It's O.K. when the person you're with fantasizes you're
          someone else, because you are.
                5) Forty years from now you'll still enjoy candy.
                4) If you don't like what you get, you can always go next
          door.
                3) It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and
          groaning.
                2) Less guilt the morning after.
                1) YOU CAN DO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.





1. At lunch time, sit in your parked car and point a hair dryer at passing 
cars, to see if they slow down. 

2. Page yourself over the intercom. (Don't disguise your voice) 

3. Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits. Wear 
them one day after your boss does. (This is especially effective if your 
boss is the opposite gender.) 

4. Send e-mail to the rest of the company to tell them what you're doing. 
For example: If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom.' 

5. Put mosquito netting around your cubicle. 

6 . Insist that your e mail address be : 
xena-goddess-of-fire@companynamecom or 
Elvis-the-King@companyname.com 


7. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with 
that. 

8. Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair 
dancing. 

9. Put your garbage can on your desk and label it 'IN.' 

10. Develop an unnatural fear of staplers. 

11. E-mail messages that advertise free pizza, doughnuts, etc., in the 
breakroom. When people complain that there was nothing there, lean back, 
rub your stomach, and say, "You've got to be faster than that." 

12. Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten 
over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso. 

13. In the memo field of all your checks, write 'for favors.' 

14. Reply to everything someone says with, "That's what you think." 

15. Finish all your sentences with "In accordance with the prophecy." 

16. Adjust the tint on your monitor so that the brightness level lights up 
the entire working area. Insist to others that you like it that way. 

16. Dont use any punctuation 

17. As often as possible, skip rather than walk. 

18. Ask people what sex they are. 

19. Specify that your drive-through order is "to go." 

20. Sing Along at the opera. 

21. Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems don't rhyme. 

22. Five days in advance, tell your friends you can't attend their party 
because you're not in the mood.
