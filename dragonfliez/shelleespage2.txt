           Now, Then, and Still

I Love you now.
I will Love you then.
And when I'm gone I will Love you still.
And I know you will Love me.
Now, Then, and Still.
Nothing will come between us.
I've learned that now.
I've started to Love you more.
But less in ways i can't control.
Because of that i want to let you go.
Something in me tells me to.
Something in me says to keep you, too.
You've done more for me than anyone could.
You have a great many things coming to you.
Hope is with us now.
Hope for things that should not be.
Life will always be against us.
Love will always be with us.
I'll keep you in my heart.
I'll keep you by my side.
We'll teach each other.
we'll show each other.
And when our time is up, I'll miss, regret, and Love you still.
And I know you will do the same.
So now you know how I feel.
So let me Love you, Now, Then, and Still.
