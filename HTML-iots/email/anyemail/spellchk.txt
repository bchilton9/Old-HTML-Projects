To install the spell checker for AnyEmail (http://netbula.com/anyemail/),
follow these instructions

1) Install the sproxy.cgi script at the same location as the anyboard.cgi
   script, make sure you checked the perl path at the first line of script
   (/usr/bin/perl) and change the script permission to make it executable.

2) Install the spch.js javascript to your www/ directory. chmod 644 on it.

3) set the $main::spellcgi to the URI of the sproxy.cgi script,
   for example, if your cgibin directory is /cgi-bin/ then

   $main::spellcgi="/cgi-bin/sproxy.cgi"; #note it starts with /

   IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUT THE FULL URL IN ABOVE, ONLY THE PART AFTER DOMAIN NAME
   THIS WON"T WORK: $abmain::spellcgi="http://anyboard.net/cgi-bin/sproxy.cgi";

4) Set $main::enable_speller = 1

  
That is it!
