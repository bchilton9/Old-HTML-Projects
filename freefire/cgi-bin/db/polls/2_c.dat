scottro|Sendace|05/03/04 - 14:54:06|I agree on MB again....we should all plan on every proggresion MOB at least twice. &nbsp;With a guild this size it will take at least that many times to get all flagged. &nbsp;<br><br>Dont be shy to try to jump in any open raids out there. &nbsp; I know i am going to if Grummus or TT or AD is opened to the public.
Briadorn|Briadorn|05/02/04 - 13:46:59|I agree...lots of people still need hedge event...including me lol. &nbsp;Lets get hedge out of the way so we can take out TT.
Osmium|Osmium|04/27/04 - 06:28:01|Need more MB to get the guild into Tactics. We'll see a major jump once we get 2-3 grps going everyday in Tactics. Nameds will be dropping like flies and gear drops coming our way.<br><br>Can't move on to TT till we get the Hedge flag for more guildies. Lots of new names on the rolls.
