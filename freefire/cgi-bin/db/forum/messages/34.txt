Re: Quicker OTMs|Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|06/01/04 - 07:22:09|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|Did we have anymore suggestions for quicker OTMs? I think what you have here is a good idea Sinnuster. I just know that I am getting tons of complaints on this issue. I know that quicker OTMs can be hard due to some getting off work late that usually always attend etc. I also know that sometimes we need to wait for certain classes to log on. And also, I know that we dont want to OTM too quickly because we leave no one behind. For Example, IG on the Agnarr was so quickly OTMing that they left people behind. I dont want to start that. Just would like to hear some more suggestions on this topic.
