Re: retirement|Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|05/29/04 - 06:45:32|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|Lumi, <br>I feel that you are one hell of a guild leader. I understand how tough it is. I helped do raids for a little guild before I joined FF, and they were raids on castle mistmoore and the members were only like 40ish-53ish. Even that was a pain in the butt. I Can see where the pressure of a lvl 63+ guild is even worse. If you don't do flags fast enough you loose people, if you dont distribute loot evenly you loose people. ETC. ETC. ETC. They are so many factors that work againest you. Its even harder because we want to be the best and so many try to hold us back. I think that spreading the raid stuff around amongest all officers will work nicely. It will just take some time to perfect it and if it doesnt work out, well we will find something that does. I helped run 1 Grummus raid while you were gone and couldnt believe the stress of just that little bit of time. If it weren't for Rayadien, I dont think Keny and I would have done very well since we had never done Grummus before at all. But, I think we should try out our new thoughts and ideas and see how they work. If we can take some of the stress off you and you can find time to enjoy the game again rather then feel like all you do in it is make sure everyone else is happy, Then I think you will find your motivation there. Well, try to relax and sit back. I will as an officer try and help you in every way I can because I think you are the greatest, and I dont want to see you unhappy. EQ is a game that is meant to be something fun we do in our spare time, and if its not fun, then why do it. I just hope that with officers helping remove some stress off you, that will help you find your fire that I know still burns deep inside of you.
