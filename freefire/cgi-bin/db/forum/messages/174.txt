Re: Guild Tournament!!|Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|06/01/04 - 07:15:19|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|Actually, from what I have seen this is going to be fun. I was helping debuff and watching the duels yesterday and they were by far great. So, I think this is a great guild motivation activity. It might also tell us where we are lacking in our own classes to learn where we need to perfect it.
