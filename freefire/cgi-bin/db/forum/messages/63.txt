Bard 1.8x Epic|Zilo|deltic@mc.net|05/06/04 - 07:10:22|Zilo|xx|24.15.240.240|Well being a relativly young character I have yet to complete most of my epic. &nbsp;From what I've read and looked up it shouldn't be all that difficult. &nbsp;Most can be killed wth single group 65. &nbsp;Some parts friends of mine already have and are willing to donate. &nbsp;So once I get up to around 50-55 I might ask for a small group every now and then to help me kill something really quick. &nbsp;I'm still hitting my goal of a lvl a day so that might be about another week or so off before I start this.[cool]<br><br>Zilo
