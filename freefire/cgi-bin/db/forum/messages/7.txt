Only admins can see this.<br><br>this link with list all the acounts that are wateing to be aproved. once aproved theay will be set as a friend acount. Then theay can be changed in the members list to a member or officer acount and have access to the parts of the forms.<br><br>i will be watching this and i will let coral know when he returns from florida and all acounts that are created that are not taged into freefire will be deleted inless there is a reason for them otherwise.<br><br>guest posting is still alowed on the general and apply forms so new members can use that to apply.<br><br>I am doing it this way to help prevent more problems in the future.<br><br>also if there is someone that is violateing the message boards in any way we can ban there ip address. Admins have access to this if you are a moderator or dont know how to ban them leave the post and let me know about it so i can ban there ip address.<br><br>lets hope we can keep the problems out befor theay happen.
