Re: Finally Deathly beated hard!|Zilo|deltic@mc.net|05/28/04 - 10:28:14|Zilo|xx|24.15.240.240|I have no clue. &nbsp;Deathly and I had litterally just dualed. &nbsp;The outcome is obvious. &nbsp;I came back to get my corpse to find Deathly no longer online with a corpse there. &nbsp;I asked the two characters in the Arena and nether one knew. &nbsp;So that is still a mystery. &nbsp;Couldn't resist the photop op though hehe.<br><br>Zilo
