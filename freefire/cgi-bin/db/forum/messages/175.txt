Re: one item left |Zmar|mduchateau13@yahoo.com|06/01/04 - 08:19:02|Zmar|xx|67.41.2.73|Can actually drop off any mob in zone. Seen it drop off a cleric mob once but very rare to drop off anything but mini bosses.
Re: one item left |Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|06/01/04 - 08:21:18|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|Ok cool. I know Keny wants to go after Magi P'tasa again for another Hate staff for the mage epic. Maybe we can get a chance at Rays drop too. Keny can solo this mob.
