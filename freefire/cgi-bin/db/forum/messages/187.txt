Leaving|Sinnuster|evilchanter@yahoo.com|06/03/04 - 07:35:43|Sinnuster|xx|129.120.69.64|After thinking about it for a while now I have decided to leave Freefire.  I have no idea where I am going, if anywhere.  For the past few weeks I have not been happy while online, and I think alot of that is the pressure of being an officer and the mess we are currently going through.  I would just step down and go back to the mindless bliss of being a member, but I don't think that is possible at this point.<br><br>Unlike others who have left you will never hear of anything negative I have said about Freefire.  As a matter of fact I will still tell people that I believe great things are ahead for this guild.  Osmium and Briadorn are good choices as officers, sence they are at most raids, if not all.  I miss alot of raids due to our otm time, which is another source of my displeasuer.  Not at the guild for having OTM when it does, but at my misfortune.<br><br>I will quietly remove myself from FF and not post anything to the message boards for the members.  This way the officers can tell them what ever they wish about my leaving.  A simple &quot;I wasn't happy.&quot; is all I will say if members ask me in tells.<br><br>There is no point in replying to this post, since I won't come back to the boards.  I am not one of those that needs to feel needed or missed, so this post isn't a way to get attention.  <br><br>If any Freefire member needs me all you have to do is send a tell and I will come help when I am able.  If you are short on chanters for a raid and need me, I make the same offer.  Since I didn't get loot as a member I won't expect it as a guest.<br><br>Good Luck Freefire!!  Get some sun glasses cause once you emerge from these most recent dark times, I see a bright future for you.<br><br><br>PS. Since sooo much issue has been brought up about loot as of late let me list my ledger in case it comes up.<br><br>Loot awarded -<br>Raid - ST key turn in<br>Group - Ornate Silk Pants Pattern (120k)<br><br>Loot/Items donated to FF - <br>Spell: Voice of Quellious x3 (40k each)<br>Spell: Vallon's Quickening (40k at time of purchase)<br>Misc drops for making Jewelry for guild mates (approx 20k)<br><br>I don't want, nor expect any of the money.  I only list this information because we have members, and some officers, that are concerned with loot more then they are moving up into EP.
