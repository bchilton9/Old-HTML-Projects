Re: Srinking and Vanishing devices|Osmium|p.hendren@mchsi.com|05/29/04 - 11:10:52|Osmium|xx|12.217.81.133|An interesting bit I've found is that the highest lvl raiding guilds across the servers consider these two devices Mandatory for everyone to carry on raids and expect members to acquire them on their own.<br><br>I am NOT saying that FF should do so, but I do see the logic. These high end guildies also usually have access to larger bankrolls than most of our members.<br><br>While I have no problem vanishing, I will be carrying a minimizing device from now on to get my big Barbarian butt out of the way.<br><br>Os
Re: Srinking and Vanishing devices|Keny Misspeller|web@eqguilded.com|05/29/04 - 15:23:18|keny|xx|24.8.91.122|Freefire is not going to fund them fully.<br><br>Theres some parts that you can only buy FF will buy thease. but alot of the parts are droped in PoI so for the bank funding the rest of the parts we expect you to earn that part by helping get the parts to make them.<br>(i hope that dosent sound rude lol)<br><br>Gears, Sproics, gnomish bolts ect all drop in PoI there cheap but if we make 100 of thease things it will rack up.<br><br>Easy kills and AA exp too so whats it goina hurt hehe.
