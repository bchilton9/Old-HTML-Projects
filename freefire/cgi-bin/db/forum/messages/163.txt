Right now we have a limmit of 5000mb data transfer per month. For the month of may as of the 27th we are at 5550mb.<br><br>To double our alowence it would coust &nbsp;$50 a year (10,000mb).<br><br>I would prefer to go up to the $80 a year package with 25,000mb becuse we will need this data transfer by the end of the year if Freefire keeps growing as the rate it is. There is even a 50,000 package for $120 a year but I dont think we will need it for the next year.<br><br>I would have no problem paying for this if I had any money. But being out of work right now I dont have anything coming in. I have already Payed the $21 for the package we have and the $5 for the domain back in Febuary.<br><br>Im asking all the members to Donate to the server just a few dolors to pay for our server.<br><br>if 50 people donate $1 it will pay for the next package up.<br>if 40 people donate $2 it will get the 25,000 package.<br><br>No one is required to do this nor is there a set number on how much to donate.<br><br>And for some people that may think this way. I will not use any of the money for anything other then the Freefire Website.<br><br>Thank You
