I through a fit to get GoD on time and I did also find it very disappointing. I understand that some are finding adventure but what about those who are not. I am behind this boycott 100%. The game has WAY too many bugs. I also heard rumor that they were going to take Planar Progression out and just let everyone into the zones, because they want everyone to see them. Im sorry but most high end guilds goals are Plane of Time. I think this needs to be earned not just handed to anyone. Just my thoughts =)
Re: Boycotting Omens of War|Vikingvoyage|nsimpson@gbronline.com|06/02/04 - 06:10:50|Vikingvoyage|xx|69.9.98.234|Aye, I myself will not be purchasing OoW until I see more of GoD and they have fixed many of the existing bugs. I was rather shocked to log in one day and see they were releasing another expansion. I have even sent feedback stateing that I wont &nbsp;buy it before they decided to postpone its release another month. &nbsp;I am disappointed with how they have handled their DX9 upgrade. I spent $80 for a new graphics card when my old one was listed as compatible with DX9, but I couldnt get in the game.
