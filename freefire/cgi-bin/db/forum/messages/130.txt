Grummus and DMF and all lev based spells.|Kulaas|wtucker_1964@hotmail.com|05/22/04 - 03:16:24|Kulaas|xx|12.218.71.95|From all I can gather, DMF is not gonna help you on this fight and only adds to everyones lag. <br><br>I got this flag on an open raid and one thing NI had us do once we got in the castle was kill ALL levs including DMF. <br>

LEV CAUSES TERRIBLE LAG. at no time during any raid unless absolutely neccesary to cross soemthign should we lev up and after which shouldimeediately be dropped the bobbing action causes massive graphic flux making lag keep this in mind please on future raids.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Trynux aka The b0at man
