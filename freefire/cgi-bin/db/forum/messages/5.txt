my epic statas|loboyoung|loboyoung1@yahoo.com.hk|04/26/04 - 07:32:17|loboyoung|xx|24.244.51.60|Only need a few more kills, <br><br>High Scale Kirn in the Hole,<br>Neh'Ashiir in CoM,<br>Iksar Child in Plane of fear,<br>Lord Rak Ashiir in CoM,<br><br> It would probally be more beneficial to the guild to concentrate on other people's epics as i think i won't have a lot of time this summer to play, but hey if anyone feels like helping me with mine i am game [smile]

Re: my epic statas|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|04/28/04 - 07:35:15|scottro|xx|12.20.105.98|On a side note. &nbsp;IF you dont know there is a way to skip a lot of this epic and go straight to the golem in Fear. &nbsp;It works. &nbsp;I did it for mine. &nbsp;<br><br>Some people like to do the whole thing. &nbsp;Totally your call. &nbsp;If you want to know more about how to do it let me know.
Re: my epic statas|loboyoung|loboyoung1@yahoo.com.hk|04/29/04 - 18:27:42|loboyoung|xx|24.244.51.60| I would for sure be interested in any short cuts that worked for you or tips. I have just been following the guide on casters realm. It seems surprising though that you don't need the drops from some of the last 4 mobs&gt;?
Re: my epic statas|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|04/30/04 - 10:55:58|scottro|xx|12.20.105.98|The quest is faction based. &nbsp;Once your faction is right you can do the final hand in. &nbsp;You can repeart the sheild and weapon turn in over and over until you recieve the message &quot;your faction could not possibley get any better&quot;<br>once you do that you need the iskar broodlings tear and to hand it in to Lord RAk. &nbsp;After that is just the final hand in. &nbsp;Then your done!
Re: my epic statas|Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|05/25/04 - 07:47:16|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|Hehe have to break into the Shammy posts here and just mention, that I have some shammy peices on Klassy. Im not sure if they are MQable or if you need them but they are as follows:<br><br>Crusades of the High Scale<br>Historic Article<br>Head Housekeepers log<br><br>Let me know if anyone needs these and can MQable. Willing to do it with anyone just let me know what to do. They have been rotting in my bank forever now and would like to put them to good use!

So they arent hard either. &nbsp;Final kill is simple also since the revamp of CoM. Can be done with one group 60 plus. &nbsp;
Re: my epic statas|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|06/02/04 - 13:16:17|scottro|xx|12.20.105.98|Its really up to the shaman if they want to do the whole thing. &nbsp;I personally just didn't see the sense in wasting my own or guilds time to get it done when its not neccessary. &nbsp;Totally up to you bro. &nbsp;If interested in learning the parts to skip just let me know. &nbsp;Cuts at least 2 fights out of the whole deal and a lot of footwork/farming. &nbsp;Like I said before, some people like to do the whole thing. &nbsp;Totally up to you.
