Idea for a loot system!|Keny Misspeller|web@eqguilded.com|05/28/04 - 13:41:40|keny|xx|24.8.91.122|iv been coming up with this today sounds like a good idea but we would have to be strict with it.<br><br>on top of the 30 day trial deal, make members have to sign up for the website and have a magelo profile linked to it and keep it up to date or no loot.<br><br>if the profiles dont match what loot theay have then theay dont get the loot on that raid.<br><br>your probly thinking what good is that going to do well keep reading =)<br><br>if there is an intrest in this i will start the programing.<br><br>I can make a part of the website that will display a list of all members signed up at the site with check boxes<br>we then check the ones on the raid.<br>we can then put in the item that drops and it will pull the stats on the item and make a list of the members on the raid that can use the item<br><br>it will then rate the need of the item based on:<br>25% = Item to be replaced<br>25% = Raid attendence<br>25% = Time in guild<br>25% = Item count recived<br><br>these numbers probly need to be changed<br><br>then the list will be ordered by highest to lowest rateing and loot can then be decifered easyer.<br><br>There will also be an aword link next to each name on the list if theay recive that item we select aword and it will be loged into the loot database and there items recived from raids count will go up 1.<br><br>There is probly a few more things to work out on this system. Please post your thoughts and ideas.

Re: Idea for a loot system!|Keny Misspeller|web@eqguilded.com|05/31/04 - 09:15:11|keny|xx|24.8.91.122|aye it will be on the spot take 2 mins i got 3 computers around me and others have it and windowed mode ect<br><br>with the 2nd computer can even start puting hte names in as theay come into the raid then when the raid starts move to the next step wate there then when an item drops put the name of the item in and get a list.
