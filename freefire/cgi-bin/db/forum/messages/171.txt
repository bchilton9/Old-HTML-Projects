Luminor,Killaana,Rayadien,Deathly. these are the raid leaders. When we do raids we will be switching who leades them, meaning not one of us will lead every raid all the time.<br><br>#3 Back Flagging.<br>Sinnuster is back flagging officer, if u need flags like PoJ, Hedge,Bot flag u need to talk with sinn or post it on message board.<br><br>#4 Loot. we are not changing the loot system but trying a few things on it to see if it helps .Crickket &amp; Klassy are Loot Trackers ( they are going to keep a list of who gets loot at raids and so on ) this should help the bickering and what ever on loot and if it dosent then we will take care of it ,<br><br>#5 The messages boards will be your key to up comming events and raid's if u do not use them u will loose out. This is a huge way of communication and with out it we cant help u if u needs us to help or if u dont use it u will not know what we are doign as a guild and where we are going.<br><br>This is just of the changes we have done and keep your eye's open for new changes to help benafit the guild.
