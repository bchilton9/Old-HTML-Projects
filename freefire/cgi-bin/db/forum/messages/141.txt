Welfare joke|Faliela|kqa@cox.net|05/25/04 - 08:17:05|Faliela|xx|170.94.59.76|As some of you know i'm a social worker in real life...in my boredom this morning (our computer system is down) I was cleaning my office and came across this list....DISCLAIMER: this joke is not meant to offend...I love my clients and find my job to be very rewarding<br><br>Sentences from actual Letters Received at the Welfare Department from Applicants for Aid<br><br>1.  I am forwarding my marriage certificate and six children. I had seven but one died which was baptized on a half sheet of paper.<br><br>2. I am writing to the welfare department to say that my baby was born two years old. When do I get my money?<br><br>3. Mrs. Jones has not had any clothes for a  year and has been visited regularly by the clergy.<br><br>4. I cannot get sick pay. I have six children, can you tell me why?<br><br>5. I am glad to report that my husband who was reported missing is dead.<br><br>6. This is my eighth child, what are you going to do about it.<br><br>7. Please find out for certain if my husband is dead, as the man I am now living with can't eat or do anything until he knows.<br><br>8. I am very much annoyed to find that you have branded my boy as illiterate as this is a  dirty lie. I was married to his father a week before he was born.<br><br>9. In answer to your letter I have given birth to a boy weighing ten pounds. I hope this is satisfactory.<br><br>10. I am forwarding my marriage certificate and my three children, one of which was a mistake, as you will see.<br><br>11. Unless I get my husband's money pretty soon, I will be forced to lead an immortal life.<br><br>12. My husband got laid off from his job two weeks ago, and I haven't had any relief since.<br><br>13. You have changed my little boy to a girl. Will this make any difference?<br><br>14. I have no children yet, as my husband is a bus driver and works day and night.<br><br>15. In accordance with you instructions, I have given birth to twins, in the enclosed envelope.<br><br>16. I want money as quickly as I get it. I have been in bed with the doctor for two weeks and he hasn't done me any good. If things don't improve, I will have to send for another doctor.

Re: Welfare joke|Nymble Feyscout|anne28_mom@yahoo.com|06/01/04 - 22:40:21|Nymble|xx|24.119.185.9|OMG!!!! Hail the fellow Social Worker )<br><br>I am a clincial social worker and I am currently working with families and children.  In the past however, I worked in Adult Mental Health.<br><br>My funniest moment (again..I don't wish to offend but it did crack me up later) was when a young man who was claiming to be Jesus Christ told me that he was married to Brooke Shields.  Hey, not a bad fantasy for most 18 year old males~<br><br>The other time was a client who claimed to be the daughter of John F. Kennedy...never mind that they would have been the same age if he were alive today.  However, her Barvarian grandmother had lied on her birth cerficate to get her into the a carvinal beer garden and so she was really only 45.  Even more ironic was that her own baby pictures and Caroline Kennedy's baby pictures did bear an uncanny resemblance. <br><br>The other funny and yet clever client was using our staff to buy her the ingredients to make her meth in her home.  We were her payee on her Social Security checks and her bank accounts.  We only figured out what she was doing because the very day I came back from shopping with her at Fred Meyer, one of my co-workers had just returned from a seminar on the last meth trends sponsored by the local law enforcement and oddly the lists matched!!!!! <br><br>Of course, for every funny client I always had five who would break your heart.  Even so it is good to find the humor in our humanity.
