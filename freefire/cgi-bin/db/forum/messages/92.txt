Loot |Faliela|kqa@cox.net|05/10/04 - 16:37:59|Faliela|xx|208.180.99.68|ok newbie officer here...please help<br><br>i have some questions about how we base our decision on awarding loot....<br><br>is it<br><br>1. Length of time in guild?<br>2. Raid attendance?<br>3. Biggest upgrade?<br>4. Lack of loot award in past?<br> <br>or <br><br>5. all of the above<br><br>I'm thinking it's all of the above and that stresses me...how are they to be prioritized...do we award an item to someone who's been in guild longer therefore attended more raids, but isn't much of an upgrade over someone who's fairly new...but really needs the upgrade? see my problem...i just want to be fair and consistant i know that's next to impossible, but i think we can improve in this area...<br><br>ideas??<br><br>My only idea is to start a spreadsheet and assign an officer at each raid to post loot awards on web page then have someone responsible for moving that info from post to spreadsheet<br><br>also would we want spreadsheet/posts to be open for viewing to all guild members?<br>
Re: Loot |Sinnuster|evilchanter@yahoo.com|05/10/04 - 16:49:20|Sinnuster|xx|129.120.69.64|Is all of the above.  Basically I ask:<br><br>Will person A getting it benefit FF more then person B getting it?<br><br>Does this person participate?<br><br>Does this person bitch alot about stuff instead of trying to change things?<br><br>Do I think the other people against this person have recieved a fair amount of loot and it is some one elses turn now?<br><br><br><br>As far as a loot databass, we have one on msg boards, and I was gonna maintain it.   BUT . . since i miss about 70% of our raids I dont have the information needed to keep it up to date.
Re: Loot |Keny Misspeller|web@eqguilded.com|05/11/04 - 02:43:36|keny|xx|4.225.199.152|ALSO consider if an item is better for one class then the other.<br><br>Example:<br><br>2hs weapon drops.<br><br>a war, bst, and sk all go for it and theay all have sbout the same weapons, time in guild ect.<br><br>who gets it?<br><br>the sk dose. war and bst have duel weld a sk dosent. with duel weld theay can deal out alot more damage. the sk needs the better 2hs weapon to deal the damage of a warrior or bst with lesser weapons.<br><br>atleast this is a stroung thing i think of. i have seen this not happen but thers no reason theay cant get both types on raids1
Re: Loot |joradan|kqa@cox.net|05/11/04 - 09:05:37|joradan|xx|170.94.59.76|good point Keny...keep em coming folks...i'm learning a lot, hehe
Re: Loot |Killaana Moonshade|nightraiser@hotmail.com|05/16/04 - 16:18:37|Killaana|xx|80.139.165.123|i don't agree with you keny, just because a class can duel wield doesn't mean they can't get a 2h slash weapon. &nbsp;If you know anything about wars is they get the most damage mitigation in the game and most put out damage with 1h slash and two hand slash. &nbsp;Like for me, i will do more damage with the staff of four winds then an sk would just because i am a warrior. &nbsp;Yes i am still pissed that realevil got that staff instead of me just because i was a war and had duel wield, i do not and never will agree to that just because they don't have duel wield and that they should get the better 2h slash.<br><br>Plus sk's have spells, they will always out damage a war same with a bst. &nbsp;War=no spells or casts, we have only weapons.<br><br>Oh and if you didn't notice, look what happened after he got that weapon, he left freefire with it. &nbsp;Yeah he came back but is he back...i only seen him on what twice. &nbsp;I just thought it was wrong that between him and me that he got it since i was at almost every raid and bust my ass for this guild and he was on like how many raids and what does he do for the guild. &nbsp;Sorry but yes that is a grudge i still hold. &nbsp;<br><br>And just one more thing, when we are big enough for RZ are you going to give the blade of war to a sk or ranger, hell no, that should be a war only weapon. &nbsp;A warrior that can tank RZ in every right deserves that weapon. &nbsp;If no war wants then by all means give to a sk or ranger, but i don't know any war that wouldn't want it. &nbsp;Does this clear things up about the 2h slash thing. &nbsp;Duel wield is nice yes, but dps comes from good 2h weapons. &nbsp;Blade of War is good example.
Re: Loot |Keny Misspeller|web@eqguilded.com|05/17/04 - 08:22:14|keny|xx|4.225.199.117|i did say thats theres no reason a warrior cant get the weapon and yes a warrior can deal out a hell of alot of dammage with it. its just one thing i look at.<br>theres been some nice items that i liked that had more wis then int and i looked at the wis based casters befor myself.<br><br>its not that i dont think a warrior deserves a 2hs weapon. its just with my experences and my knolage of the gmae and classes i have seen more dammage out put from 4 hits with 1h weapons then 2 hits with 2h weapons even tho the numbers on the 2h are higher<br><br>i never once sead that a sk will automadly get it over a warrior or bst im just saying that one of the key factors in my choice.
Re: Loot |Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|06/01/04 - 07:12:40|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|I think that the biggest part of getting loot does have to do with time in guild and attendance. Makes since to me. For example, ( I dont mean anything at all bad by this. I have learned my lesson and hold no grudge so please dont judge me.) I have noticed that Crickket has gotten quite a few more items over me, and I have been in the guild a little bit longer, but Crickkets gear was by far worse then mine, and plus most of the gear she welds were all from raids that I couldnt attend. So, it does seem fair that she got it because she has worked her arse off on the raids and made a point to be there. It wouldnt be fair for me to get that stuff like shes got if I hardly ever attended the raids and went one raid out of every 10 and got items and she was left behind. So, I think that it was distruibited fairly there. Another factor we may look at just as a thought, and I dont mean anything bad by this once again is, that we consider how hard someone has worked for there gear. For Example, Crickket works her bottom off to get the Ldon gear because it is better then what she has (I know she is working on it right now) and I dont work at all for my gear. I come to a raid and have the worst because I didnt try to upgrade my gear and Crickket has a decent item because she worked for it. If I were to get the loot it wouldnt be fair. (Sorry for using you as an example Crickket just easiest to compair with another druid) <br><br>As a side note, I do see where Keny is comming from, but I also see where you are too Killaana. Because, I heard a complaint about a helm that dropped somewhere that a druid won and that it was more taliored for a shaman. But, this particular helm was Cleric, Druid, Shaman. Whos says that would be a better shammy item? Apparently, a cleric or druid would benefit from it the same. If we were to really start getting into the nitty gritty it would not only be a pain, but could arise more problems.<br><br>I have learned that loot is not really that important to me. I figuered out that we will all eventually get better gear to take out some of these nasty mobs. I can wait. I personally now would rather see others get an item over me. I dont have bad gear, I am lacking a bit in FT but I feel I can get some Ldons of my own and earn my FT. It shouldnt be handed to me. Keny made me realize that we will all eventually get the upgrades. Of course this does not mean I wont try for upgrades if they really are a upgrade, it just means I am done worrying about getting better gear. I will get there someday. But, if there is an item that is not really an upgrade I probably wont go for it cause I do know that there are others in the guild who might have worse then me. I plan on attending all raids that I can, and I never go to try and benefit myself. I want to see this guild go far.
Re: Loot |joradan|joradanice@hotmail.com|06/01/04 - 09:26:54|joradan|xx|170.94.59.75|Personally, loot arguements and grudges make me want to stop playing the game. <br>I suggest we simplify things, and make this a /rand 1000 guild. Maybe put some stipulations on it, i.e., the item must be usable by that person, must be an upgrade, and they must be willing to pass down their old item (if it is not no drop) to the guild. Then, it is all up to chance, if someone doesn't get a certain item, it's no one's fault. <br>All are treated fairly. Period.<br>Why would officers NOT want to random all loot? That answer is an issue of Control and Power. If all loots are /rand 1000 then no officer has any &quot;control&quot; over who get's it, it is left up to chance. PLUS it takes a HUGE burden off of the officers when it comes time to decide on loot. Simplicity my friends. Consider it and think on it for a while. I think you will agree with me.<br>Thoughts?
