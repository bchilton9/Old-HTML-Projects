HoH Trials (Virgin Trial)|Sinnuster|evilchanter@yahoo.com|05/26/04 - 08:18:54|Sinnuster|xx|129.120.69.64|Summary: This is one of the three trials needed in order to enter the Temple of Marr where Mithaniel Marr resides. Alekson Garn's trial is the easiest of the three trials. Once the trial is triggered, you'll need to protect some innocent virgins from the mean guys that spawn all around them. If you protect the virgins and beat the bad guys, you win. (See the map below for the basic layout.) If Alekson Garn is alive in the zone, his trial can be activated. If he's not there, then the trial cannot be activated. With a few tricks, a group of 18 should be able to do this trial, but it's designed for a raid of 40 to 60 players. <br><br>Getting There: Believe it or not, this is probably the hardest part about doing all three trials in a single evening with time to spare. If you can move your raid quickly and (nearly) flawlessly from trial to trial, you win! If not, you'll waste an hour or more just moving people around. <br><br>Make sure your entire raid has downloaded and installed the cartography maps for this zone. Without maps, people will get lost and will scatter corpses all over the zone. Make sure your entire raid has stocked up on cloudy potions prior to the raid. These potions are instant-cast and will save lives and save tons of time as you move through the zone. Even classes that can invis should have several of these in inventory, hotkeyed and ready to activate. <br><br>Have your raid invis up and follow their cartography maps to meet inside Alekson Garn's room. It's all left-hand-turns from the zone-in. The best meeting spot is right in the middle on the black center tile. Nothing will aggro you here. If someone spots a see-invis mob on the way to the meeting location, you'll need to make sure the entire raid knows where that mob is and how to avoid it. You may want to dispatch a single group to go find and kill the see-invis mob to make movement easier after you're done with the trial. <br><br>Duration of Raid: Once this trial is activated it takes about twenty minutes to complete. It's getting there and the prep work that will add to your total time. Plan to spend 45 minutes on this trial alone from the time your raid enters the zone and is ready to move. <br><br>Melee: This isn't the typical boss mob fight with a single hard-hitting mob tanked by a single tank. You'll need to plan to deal with up to eight mobs who will all spawn on your raid at the same time. It's best to set up off-tanks and pair them with healers before you trigger the cycle. You'll also need a method of quickly healing people who take damage or you will suffer heavy casualties until you've got the first group of mobs under control. <br><br>Spells: None of the mobs during this trial cast any spells of note. <br><br>Triggered Events and Scripts: Here's the order of events. <br><br>Green light: Raid is buffed and ready and located in the center of Alekson Garn's room. The second and third rooms of the Alekson Garn basement have a small kite team in them consisting of two druids or bards. This is essential. Without kiters in the second and third rooms, the virgins will be kidnapped and defiled by the bad men and you will lose. <br><br>Trigger: Main tank walks up to Alekson Garn, hails him, and says, &quot;Ready&quot; Immediately, A Custodian of Marr spawns and begins wailing on the main tank. The CoM quads for about 900 max and is mostly slowable (mitigates Shaman slows to &quot;mostly&quot;). When he reaches zero percent, the trial starts, so be sure you are ready. Have someone call his health in the raid channel so that everyone is ready for the trial to begin. At about 20% you should back all knights and warriors off of the Custodian of Marr and have them stand ready for the adds that are about to spawn. <br><br>Crazy Dudes: Once the trigger is down, approximately 15 to 21 crazy dudes spawn -- that's five to seven of them in each room. The main raid force will kill all of them in the main room while the kiters in the other two rooms keep the crazy dudes in their rooms busy and away from the virgin wenches. In the main room, you'll have your MT call assist on each of the crazy dudes one by one until only ONE is left. Once you're down to the last one, simply off-tank him for a bit and make sure you've got everyone rezzed and ready. When the final mob in each room dies, he spawns a very mean named. <br><br>Advocent Joran: Advocent Joran is the name of the mob that spawns in the same room as Alekson Garn once your raid has dispatched all of the trash mobs in this room. He spawns immediately after the last mob dies, and he is quite mean. You'll probably lose one or two people before your main tank can locate and aggro him. He flurries and quads for a max of 1115 (do the calculation, that's a max of about 9k damage in a single unlucky round!) and is slightly slowable. You'll want a proper, fast cleric rotation on the MT once he's established aggro. <br><br>Room Two: Once Advocent Joran is dead (he drops no loot) you'll move the entire raid force to the second room. Have chanters and other casters begin to peel mobs off one by one via mez and root. Once you've got a few of the mobs that were being kited locked down with mez and root, call your kiters in and kill the mobs one by one. When you are down to the last mob in this room, Halgoz Rellinic will spawn. Like Advocent Joran, he's mean. You'll want to make sure your raid is ready for him before you order the final trash mob killed. <br><br>Halgoz Rellinic: Halgoz Rellinic rampages instead of flurries and hits for about the same as Advocent Joran. His rampage is difficult to set properly because he spawns out of ether as soon as you kill the last mob in the room. The best way to deal with this is to make sure that all of your tanks are prepared to drop an arrow into him the moment he appears -- they want to get near the top of his rampage list as quickly as possible. Once Halgoz Rellinic is down, take a moment to rez and rebuff and to deal with any loot that he has dropped. When you're ready, move the raid force into the third and final room. <br><br>Room Three and Freegan Haun: Move the entire raid force to the third room. Have chanters and other casters begin to peel mobs off one by one via mez and root. Once you've got a few of the mobs that were being kited locked down with mez and root, call your kiters in and kill the mobs one by one. When you are down to the last mob in this room, Freegan Haun will spawn. Like the two named before him, he'll kill you fast if you're not ready for him. Make sure your raid is ready for him before you order the final trash mob killed. He also rampages and hits about as hard as Halgoz Rellinic. Deal with him in the same way. <br><br>Flag Time!: Now that you've cleared all three rooms of trash mobs and of named, you can finish your flagging. Instruct your raid force to run back to Alekson Garn's room and hail him. If the hail is successful it will not result in any yellow flag text. Alekson Garn will simply respond with about two lines of text that say, &quot;An ethereal mist descends from the air and surrounds your very being. Your body begins to emanate with the power of Alekson Garn.&quot; Now you just need to complete the trials of Rhaliq Trell and Trydan Faye in order to enter the Temple of Marr (HoHb). <br><br>Buff Strategy: Ideally, you'll conserve cleric and druid MGB and pop them both when you kill the Custodian of Marr -- this is probably the most delicate time in the raid and the healing from these two spells can make a large difference. At all other times you'll want the standard compliment of buffs. Resists are unimportant for this trial. DPS is also relatively unimportant -- go for HP buffs on everyone because the difficulty here is dealing with many mobs all at once. Everyone needs a couple extra seconds of survival so that you can get these mobs locked down. <br><br>Healing Strategy: As mentioned above, it helps to pair knights with dedicated healers to improve their chances of survival. <br><br>Risk Management: The most common reason for failing this trial is when your kiters fail (die) and allow the bad men in the second and third rooms to assualt the innocent virgins. Once that happens, the trial is over and all mobs poof. Then you've just got to move on, because they won't respawn for approximately two hours. It's rare that you'll actually wipe out to the spawn of mobs in the first room -- they're dangerous, and you will suffer casualties, but it's doubtful that they'll actually wipe you if you are careful not to trigger Advocent Joran when you are in the middle of rezzing and buffing. Kiting is really the key to this fight -- though you can also split your raid force into three groups and divide them evenly amongst the three rooms.
