MrPickpocket|So you're gonna sue me, huh?|04/17/04 - 08:58:35|If I could have your name and website of work so I can see just how good of a big, bad, insane and determined lawyer you really are, according to your wife and Deathly... I want to check to see what I'm up against.<br><br>If you're anything close to a good lawyer (from the sound of it, NOPE) you'd know there's witnesses and proof saying and showing I wasn't on Tetsuro doing that stuff last night, and my IP address was indeed hijacked from some asshole-kid in my neighborhood... but I won't even try to convince you anymore. I'm done with that. But I would like to point out you have no case; I'm not even a lawyer and I know that... so I hope you have a ton of time to waste, because I do. Any reasonably good lawyer would realize it wasn't me, and they are going to have a hard-time proving it when all the evidence points to Tetsuro NOT being me that night and the GM's know it.<br><br>So just reply with your record, name, etc. so I can follow-through with some background checks and some homework of my own to see how much of a real lawyer (an insane and determined one at that) you really are. :)<br><br>See you in court... lemme know what I need to know so you can hear from my lawyer. If you want his info I can give it to you just so you know I am not lying... unlike some people...|1082210299|aicon2|1|1|1
