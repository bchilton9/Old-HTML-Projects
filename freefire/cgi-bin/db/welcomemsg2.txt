Welcome to Freefire!
 I wanted to start by saying what goals this guild has planned for the future. &nbsp;Our intent is to try our hardest to make it to plane of time. &nbsp;We will also try to have a friendly and relaxed atmosphere as this guild progresses along its journey's. &nbsp;This guild likes to hire determined loyal hard working members. &nbsp;This is in no way a guild for loot hounds or lazy players. &nbsp;Our style of play I hope serves all in this guild, for those that it doesn't serve I am sorry and wish them luck elsewhere. So like I said our future goal is plane of time. &nbsp;I am looking for people who are determined to get there. &nbsp;No whiners naggers or non loyal people, cause this train is ready to roll.<br>Thnx,Luminor. <br><br>Patience is a virtue...........<br><br><br>&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Please note new members if you are not taged into freefire your acount will NOT be aproved! If you want to apply you can post as a guest on the apply form!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
