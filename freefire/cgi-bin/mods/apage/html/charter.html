The meaning of the word freefire to this guild and it's members is the burning desire in ones heart to adventure.I myself have the fire within to lead this group of special members we have in this guild.I will start by saying we are a guild of friendship ,honor and pride.We do raid twice a week and possible other days if the guild members wish this and there fire burns to raid more.There are no mandatory on the moves = OTM.The loot system for our raids is simple,we ask that our members show the slot they wish to have upgraded,then the officers and guild leader vote on who we feel really need the upgrade to help benefit this member and the guild better.The better the member is,so goes the guild.I require those who seek the fire within,to only apply with there mains.I am not saying alts cant go with us on raids,just wont be guild tagged.The alt may have an opportunity on loot if approved by the GL.If the alt is required to go then yes same rights as a main.During a raid is the only time an alt will be tagged but must remove the tag after raid is over.I also ask that when you seek the fire you be of lvl 60 or above please.IF you seek the fire within with us feel free to fire away and apply,if not we wish you fair well and good luck.
