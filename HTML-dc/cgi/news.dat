                 Guild Magic has been removed from the site and isnot required to sign up for anymore.  I felt this was just a repeat roster of something we allready had.  The roster our dear brother Keny designed is a beter fit for the guilds needs.
        
                 Liluvdar has been promoted to Asst. Guild Leader, Keny has been promoted to Commanding General and will head up the War Dept.
