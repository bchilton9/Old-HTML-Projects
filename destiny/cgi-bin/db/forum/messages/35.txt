Rules Amendment #1|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|05/11/05 - 17:01:54|volizden|xx|68.92.120.228|I purpose to have this rule amended to the guild rules as follows:<br><br>Guild members should follow the EULA to the letter, in the sense of any bannable offense in the game. Utilizing Cheats, Bots/Macros, Bugs Etc. If any guild member is found to be breaking this rule INSTANT REMOVAL FROM THE  GUILD WILL OCCUR.<br><br>If a person is suspected of doing so they WILL BETURNED INTO GM's for investigation with NO WARNING. We believe in keeping the game play as pure as possible and fair to those whom follow the rules. we therefor will hold true to this by enforcing this rule.<br><br>Please vote on this post, or type an amendment compareable and submitt it for vote.<br><br>Thanks

Re: Rules Amendment #1|Calidan|SkylyJay@gmail.com|05/15/05 - 23:55:29|Calidan|thumbup|4.153.71.35|I agree, but I suggest dont specificly saying follow the EULA to the letter. &nbsp;Just to follow the rules of the game as set forth by soe, maybe, imo following the EULA to the letter sounds a lil harsh.
