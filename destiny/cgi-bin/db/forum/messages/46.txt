Guild Events|Bubba|firedawg@Zoominternet.net|05/30/05 - 23:12:12|Bubba|lamp|152.130.7.3|Ok anyone have ideas for some guild events? &nbsp;a few of us went on a spur-of-the-moment master chest hunt in Zek the other day, no luck, but was alot of fun. &nbsp;Anyone have any other ideas for events we can plan? &nbsp;A couple ideas I have are below:<br><br>Trembling Lagoon (Lv36? Epic x2's in Feerrott)<br>Avitars of Jealousy (Guild Raid in Shattered Vale in Ant lv 17?)<br>Bloodline Chronicles (Adventure pack, about 10 quests long, reward=vampire form (lv 40 mobs))<br><br>Any other ideas or comments let me know
Re: Guild Events|Viciouss|nboliviero@verizon.net|05/31/05 - 09:52:51|Viciouss|xx|71.97.16.7|o i really like those ideas. here's some of mine:<br><br>lvl 10 guild raid (we're almost there).<br>Cauldron Hollow Raid<br>Everling Group<br><br><br>if we do CH, then take out everling, that will finish up ghoulbane for me, and i can then finish hadden's earring pretty easy.

Re: Guild Events|Ferrik|jenn-kev@comcast.net|06/02/05 - 11:48:29|Ferrik|lamp|192.91.147.34|Here are some events ideas I put together that might help:<br><br>RAIDS:<br>- Guild Raid (Weekly Writ Raids) - Avatar of Jealousy, etc.<br>- Guild Raid (Epic Mobs) - For quests, Master Chests, and some even give SP<br>- Guild Raid (Dungeon Crawl) - Explore a dungeon as a guild, mentor down so not grey<br>- Guild Raid (Heritage Quest) - Plenty of Heritage quests require a raid at some point<br><br>SOCIAL:<br>- Hide &amp; Seek - Plenty of great zones to do this in (no tracking allowed! lol)<br>- Scavenger Hunts - Competing groups given a list of items to collect from all over Norrath<br>- Races - These range from Naked Gnome to Drunken Dwarf, Relay Races to Long Distance Marathons, plenty of possibilities<br>- Rescue Mission - Use a higher level to grey out a dungeon to place a character down at the bottom, then lead a mission to rescue him and return him to safety<br>- Fishing Tournament - Not sure how this will work in this game, but has been great fun in others<br>- Harvest Festival - Similar to Fishing Tournament, but using other harvesting nodes<br>- Tavern Night - Get everyone together in a tavern to drink ale and share stories of their adventures<br>- Bard's Tale - Find a nice stage somewhere and be impressed with the talent of your guildmates<br>- House Hopping - Travel together from house to house for a guild party to see each other's decorating skills (include door prizes, lol)<br>- Corpse Art - Find unique ways to express yourself with the dead (Massacre on the Qeynos Bridge, Mage Tower Suicide Pact, etc.) &nbsp;Don't forget to post the screenshots!<br>- Server Events - Plan an event for the entire server to participate in! &nbsp;Great way to build our reputation!<br>- Crafting Night - Get everyone together in the Ironforge Exchange tradeskill instance and craft together as a guild (for writs, xp, and money)<br>- (I'll add more as I think of them...)<br><br>When I was events officer for one of my old guilds, I created a character named Special. &nbsp;Every few weeks (usually once a month), I would do some kind of &quot;Special Event&quot; that would advance his story and use ideas like the ones above. &nbsp;It took a lot of planning, but everyone loved it and it was great for retention and recruiting!<br><br>Oh, and Guild Level 10 Raid is reached from a tower in the Commonlands, lots of undead camps in an instance. &nbsp;Can't remember the name of the zone right now, but it's a valley with a trail that dead ends. &nbsp;Pretty fun when we did it once before with Destiny, though organizing it took five times as long as completing it.<br><br>Some other things to consider with planning events:<br>- Day/Time: &nbsp;When will you get the most participation? &nbsp;Better to establish a day/time weekly or vary it each event?<br>- Level: &nbsp;Be careful not to alienate lower level characters from events every time (sometimes is okay).<br>- Duration: &nbsp;Keep the events to a reasonable timeframe so it's not tedious to participate.<br>- Variety: &nbsp;The best event ever too often repeated will still get old.<br>- Reward: &nbsp;Sometimes a nice reward for attendance or a little competition can spice things up.<br>- Recruiting: &nbsp;Incorporate recruiting into events sometimes, let people bring friends. &nbsp;They may eventually join the guild or at least spread good stuff about us.<br>- Cooperation: Sometimes an event will go better if you get other guilds involved. &nbsp;An alliance never hurts when you need more help than one guild can support.<br>- Retention: &nbsp;Games get old and new ones are always coming out. &nbsp;MMORPGs are getting more and more popular, so make this game special to keep people having fun and sticking around.<br>- Publicize: &nbsp;If you're going to go to all the trouble to plan and execute an event, make sure people know about it and show up! &nbsp;Give them plenty of notice and use different announcements (not everyone will check the web site, MOTD, etc.).<br>- Have FUN!
