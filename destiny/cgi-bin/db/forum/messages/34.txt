Estu|Volizden Razorscale|volizden@gmail.com|05/11/05 - 16:54:46|volizden|xx|68.92.120.228|It has been brought to our attention that Estu may be using a BOT. It was brought up to an officer and that officer sent an ingame e-mail to me. I have Logged a /petition to GM's to investagate this accusation.<br><br>I purpose not removing Estu at this time becuase we have no proof, but have asked the GM to let me know if he is and that way we can soften any &quot;Bad Rep&quot; that may come of this by telling people yes we know and we turned him into the GMs for it, Etc. Also if we remove him it may cause him to be wary and I would preffer him to be caught if it is the case.<br><br>At this time we have no Guideline in the guild rules about using Macros/Bots This I feel should be a removable offense. Now at this time we have no way of knowing if someone is using a BOT or not unless we report them to a GM.<br><br>With this I purpose a new line be aded to the rules and will list it in a seperte post for vote.<br><br>Sorry for the bad news
