Please contact me in some way if you already have access to this zone.<br><br>As for the other raid that day, it will be our lvl 10 guild raid, Daughters of Lucan. ya, anyways i'll inform you more as we get closer. and, just keep your attention, I've got plans for other events after this that I don't feel like revealing now [tongue][evil]<br><br><br>DATE: 5/21<br>TIME: PDT 6pm, MDT 7pm, CDT 8pm, EPT 9pm
