Ferrik Lastname?|Ferrik|jenn-kev@comcast.net|06/01/05 - 10:22:17|Ferrik|question|192.91.147.34|I've been playing Ferrik as my main character through several games now, but he's never had a last name.  I've spent so much time with Ferrik that I want to be sure I choose a great last name for him.  Unfortunately, choosing the perfect last name has me stumped.<br><br>I put a lot of thought into Ferrik as a first name.  He was originally a dwarf cleric on Ferran's Hope server.  I wanted something with a connection to his server, so grabbed &quot;Ferr&quot;.  Ferric is related to iron, which is a good link for a dwarf.  As for his class, well Ferrik the Cleric has a nice ring to it!<br><br>Most dwarf last names have some connection with mining or their professions.  Most consist of two normal words (Ironforge, Gemchopper, etc.).  Ferrik is an armorer usually, so I've been trying to tie in &quot;forge&quot; somehow.  I've also been trying to use something with a cleric connection. &nbsp;And of course, it has to sound good with the first name (trying to use an &quot;F&quot; in it somewhere and probably two or three syllables).<br><br>With that, here are some possible names I've considered:<br>[list][*]Ferrik Soulforge (think someone else is using this last name, but I still like it)<br>[*]Ferrik Okcide (just call me Rusty, lol)<br>[*]Ferrik Forgehammer<br>[*]Ferrik Fateforger<br>[*]Ferrik Holyforge<br>[*]Ferrik Spiritforge<br>[*]Ferrik Templar<br>[*]Ferrik Faithforge<br>[*]Ferrik Lightforge<br>[*]Ferrik (no last name)<br>[/list]<br>Some good words:[list][*]Race: beard<br>[*]Class: soul, faith, fate, smite, divine, healer, cleric, templar, priest, holy, undead, temple, prayer, light, radiant, cleanse, minister, reverent, grace, sermon, penitent, bless, dogma, belief, penance, celestial, protect, savior, oath, honor<br>[*]Tradeskill: forge, fire, gem, stone, flame, ore, temper, hammer, smithy, anvil, armor<br>[/list]<br>This post is mostly a place I can keep my thoughts until I come up with a final name, but please offer any suggestions you may have.  Also, I found a really cool name generator site that I wanted to share:<br>[url]http://www.seventhsanctum.com/index-name.php[/url]<br><br>Safe Travels,
