Re: MERGER to anew GUILD Sanctuary|Ehen|ehen@blueyonder.co.uk|05/18/05 - 06:22:08|ehen|xx|194.6.79.200|I'd been thinking for some time that we needed an injection of new blood. Even at peak playing times, there can't be many more than 8-10 Destiny members on and playing. <br><br>The only major downside as I see it is that we will be starting from scratch again. However, a more active guild shouldn't take too long to get back up to a decent level. <br><br>Most people probably know at least some of the members involved from 'the other side' anyway and I know I personally have always got on pretty well with the ones that I know and have grouped with.<br><br>As Vol says, be a bit chaotic for some time if we go ahead but nothing that can't be resolved. In short, I'm for it as long as we think it through properly before agreeing to it and that the membership on the whole agree.

Guild name????<br><br><br>o, and, this obviously means that the guild event for this weekend will most likely be CANCELLED. This is not for sure of course, but with the chaos and depending on when it happens....go ahead and count on it being cancelled and postponed to next week.<br><br><br><br>wait, i got another really important question....actually, it's kinda a stupid question and so i'll put it like this:<br>I guess pyliden won't be joining for a while later....cuz of &quot;issues&quot; (those who know what i'm talking about have advised me not to make the info public and to keep quiet, so i shall, but at least Voli should know wat i mean).

Re: MERGER to anew GUILD Sanctuary|Vaachu|dmcilvain2@mchsi.com|05/19/05 - 18:22:48|Vacchu|xx|12.218.111.241|I am pretty new to the guild and have yet to really participate in any events but to &nbsp;me this appears to be a good move. &nbsp;If, in fact we do have a bad rep for whatever reason this will likely fix that as well as form a guild of more active players. &nbsp;As for the starting over at lvl 1, as stated above by Ethen, a more avtive guild will have no problem leveling back up. &nbsp;In short I am all for this merge and I completely support Volizden.
Re: MERGER to anew GUILD Sanctuary|Raijin|jerry21w@hotmail.com|05/20/05 - 18:01:44|maymer|xx|24.175.221.176|I have no negative issues toward the move. A fresh start maybe just what we need to begin a new foundation from which to build. And to be honest, I am not here for the guild name or the guild level or perks. I continue to be a member of this guild because of the people in it. So, I am pro merger, and will glady follow. &nbsp;
Re: MERGER to anew GUILD Sanctuary|Ferrik|jenn-kev@comcast.net|05/20/05 - 22:41:19|Ferrik|xx|68.54.169.80|Since I've been out of town for work and unable to play for the last week, I'm feeling a little blindsided by the whole thing. &nbsp;I'm not opposed to a merger, I'd just like more information before it happens. &nbsp;Could someone answer a few questions for me?<br><br>Which guilds will be participating in the merger? &nbsp;You mentioned three or more, but didn't list any guild names.<br><br>The thread subject implies that the new guild will be named Sanctuary. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;Are we just joining the existing Sanctuary?<br><br>When will the merger take place exactly?<br><br>What will we need to do to join the new guild once the merger takes place?<br><br>Will a new guild be created from scratch or will we actually just be jumping ship and joining an existing guild?<br><br>Will this be an all or nothing merger? &nbsp;Meaning, will Destiny be disbanded during the process or will people have the option to move to the new guild?<br><br>What happens to officers and patrons during the merger since it doesn't necessarily make sense to keep that many officers and patrons from multiple guilds? &nbsp;For example, if three guild with 15 patrons each merge, all of them cannot possibly remain patrons. &nbsp;For officers it isn't exactly the same, but having tons of officers may cause issues too.<br><br>From the work that Volizden and others seem to be putting into the merger, it sounds like it has already been decided and you are just working out the details. &nbsp;You're our leaders and that's your call. &nbsp;Given the choice of staying in a leaderless guild or following you to a new guild... well, that's a pretty easy decision. &nbsp;Sorry if I sound upset about this, but I was just getting used to the new and improved Destiny then I go away for a week and return to find out that we've given up on Destiny and we're moving on to Option B. &nbsp;Not that Option B is necessarily a bad thing, it's just that I didn't realize that Option A wasn't working out.

You mentioned three or more[/b]<br><br>The only other guild name mention so far is White Rose a splinter group within them that is dissatisfied with how it is going are looking into this merger as an alternative. the other splinter groups I am unsure of. So Destiny, Sanctuary, and White Rose for sure with other, either independants or some splinter groups possible also<br><br>2) [b]Are we joining an already existing guild Sanctuary?[/b]<br><br>The Existing guild is Sanctuary Started by a couple former member Tranquility and Bubba. They tell me it will be lvl 5 by the end of the week or this weekend. Currently there are 7 members in Sanctuary.<br><br>3) [b]When will the merger take place exactly?[/b]<br><br>UNKNOWN at this point in time, the saturday deadline is when we need to give them a yes or no answer for the go ahead planning. We can decide to do it this weekend or next week, but for us to lock into terms I would suggest as soon as we decide up or down.<br><br>4) [b]What will we need to do to join the new guild once the merger takes place?[/b]<br><br>We will need to decide Whom in Desitny guild will become our lead in the new guild and of course we will need to desband from destiny then Join the new guild. All full officers will retain there old positions as full officers in the new guild. All Member leaving Destiny to join Sanctuary will Be full Members in the new guild.<br><br>5) [b]Will a new guild be created from scatch or will we actually be jumping ship and joining an existing guild?[/b]<br><br>Redundant question see answer to Question 2)<br><br>6) [b]Will this be an all or nothing merger? Meaning will destiny be disbanded during the process or will people have the option to move to the new guild?[/b]<br><br>No, this is not all or nothing, and No Destiny will not be disbanded, But Destiny will be Severely Crippeled as so far it looks that most of the active players are for a merger. You can opt to stay with the guild if you so desire.<br><br>6) [b]What happens to officers and patrons during the merger since it doesn't necessarily make sense to keep that many officers and patrons from multiple guilds?  For example, if three guild with 15 patrons each merge, all of them cannot possibly remain patrons.  For officers it isn't exactly the same, but having tons of officers may cause issues too.[/b]<br><br>As stated in answer to Question four Officers remain officers, Members join to FULL membership, the patron on the other hand WILL be limited to 12 MAX to start. The fine details of the patrons will be worked out in the officer meetings after the merger.<br><br>THIS LAST IS A STATMENT NOT A QUESTION REALLY BUT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED PIECE BY PIECE:<br><br>[b]From the work that Volizden and others seem to be putting into the merger, it sounds like it has already been decided and you are just working out the details. You're our leaders and that's your call. [/b]<br><br>No the only thing that was decided was the terms I thought best Initially and work out. I stated then I would Accept no less then those term before presenting to our guild. I am not Destiny, You are. The leadership is not the &quot;ORDER&quot; here, you are. The people make the guild the leadership abides by thier decisions and suggests courses of action and enforce the rules. WE DO NOT RUN THE GUILD AS WE SEE FIT WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO.<br><br>[b]Given the choice of staying in a leaderless guild or following you to a new guild... well, that's a pretty easy decision.[/b]<br><br>No reply needed<br><br>[b]Sorry if I sound upset about this, but I was just getting used to the new and improved Destiny then I go away for a week and return to find out that we've given up on Destiny and we're moving on to Option B.  Not that Option B is necessarily a bad thing, it's just that I didn't realize that Option A wasn't working out.[/b]<br><br>What wasnt working out with &quot;Option A&quot; was we have gotten three new members in the last month. Those that have been looking have heard about the bad rep we have, or how much of a joke we are, Etc etc. Viciouss, himself, saw it first hand in a group he was in and can relay his expriance himself. Ehen can rely his Experiances of snippets comments. I my self can tell you of comming to the defense of our name. Sadly We are a joke to most people on this server. We need to get away from the name to get away from that. BUT if the guild decides to stay and fight it out then that what the guild will do.
Re: MERGER to anew GUILD Sanctuary|Ferrik|jenn-kev@comcast.net|05/21/05 - 09:03:51|Ferrik|xx|68.54.169.80|Thanks for the quick response! &nbsp;I guess I've just never had any first hand experience that Destiny is considered &quot;a joke to most people on this server&quot;. &nbsp;If the bad rep is creating problems with joining groups and recruiting new members, then moving to a new guild makes sense. &nbsp;I'll admit Destiny had a shaky start with mass recruiting then absent leadership for a while, but I guess I didn't realize how bad that hurt us in the long run.<br><br>I didn't mean to offend you with the comment about you being the leaders and it is your call. &nbsp;But, in a way it is true. &nbsp;Our inputs might help you make the decisions, but in the end being our officers means you will make the final call. &nbsp;That isn't a bad thing, it's just part of the responsibilities you take on in leadership. &nbsp;I'm an officer in the military, so maybe we have a different perspective. &nbsp;Again, no offense intended.<br><br>Since we're talking about officers, you mention that &quot;We will need to decide Whom in Desitny guild will become our lead in the new guild&quot;. &nbsp;You also mentioned that we will maintain a tribunal lead system, so does this mean we will have a lead from Destiny, White Rose, and Sanctuary? &nbsp;I just wanted to make sure I read that right. &nbsp;How will this decision be made?<br><br>Since we have been working to raise the guild level so much lately, the patron issue will be an important one to sort out. &nbsp;Starting with 12 patrons MAX sounds like a good plan, but how will those dozen be decided? &nbsp;I'm assuming that since we are joining Sanctuary and they are trying to reach level 5 very soon, that all of their patrons will be part of that first dozen. &nbsp;How many does that leave for the two other guilds? &nbsp;<br><br>I've really enjoyed being a patron the last few weeks as I completed heritage quests and writs, but there is a good chance that I will lose that part of being in a guild when we merge. &nbsp;Depending on how you decide to choose patrons, I may not even be a good choice since I have completed a few heritage quests already. &nbsp;It might sound a little selfish, but this is one of my biggest concerns with the merger proposal.<br><br>So, with all that said... you've got a thumbs up from me. &nbsp;Let me know any further details as they are decided and how I can help out to make the transition smoother.

I was in a group, forget if there were 5 or 6 of us. 1 of them asked for a good guild to join. Being a supporter of our guild, i obviously told him he could join us. 2 of the other members there did not have guild tags, but they're alts were part of TDS (the downward spiral, lvl 40 min to join, which is why they didn't have the tags) started laughing and saying how destiny was not a good choice due to &quot;our problems with leveling, leadership, and maintaining members&quot;.<br><br><br><br>on a better note, if only one person from destiny is to be a leader of the new guild, and then one from Sanc and one from White Rose, my vote has to go to Volizden. sorry to say, but i just think he fulfills a bit better of a leader role than Calidan, since he is able to be online much more (no offense to Cal, i understood that he has been working a lot lately and stuff and RL easily takes over EQ). Plus, another bonus to volizden over calidan, is we always have Nierah for when he's not there.
