Chat Mod for WebAPP.

This is a simple chat script, there is no server and no set-up. 

*** It does require a working version of the showhtml mod *** OR launch it into a new window

Installation will work if you have the standard WebAPP set-up, 
it may work anyway as it reads the WebAPP variables to find everything.

Upload the chat folder into your mods directory.

Chmod the chat folder to 755

Chmod everything except the .cgi files to 777

Chmod the .cgi files to 755

Copy the html file to your root directory (or html directory) it should end up being 
at http://www.yourdomain.com/chat.list.html

To add a link to the chat script add 
http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/mods/showhtml/showhtml.pl?url=www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/mods/chat/index.cgi
as a link.

Nothing else is needed but if you want to change anything start in chat.pl and then chat.cgi
I have commented what configures what.

If need more information or would like assistance you can email me at web@4132.co.uk or
of course leave a message on my WebAPP site at http://www.simonj.co.uk
