AD|Kulaas|wtucker_1964@hotmail.com|05/19/04 - 18:49:15|Kulaas|xx|12.218.71.95|I read some posts about this kill, and one grabbed my attention quick. Those Golems did not come to life until way deep into fight, and even then, a few at a time. If we had all our DPS on AD, I think he would have been ours. The post says have druids worry about parking and kiting the golems as they come to life a few at a time, this way AD is dead from sheer DPS before all the golems come to life. The post says if AD is down and some golems are not awake, they remain sleeping. We wiped with AD at 20% or so and I tend to believe had all the dps been focused on her he would have been ours.<br><br><br>Just some info from a few posts I read and maybe a new thing we should try.<br><br>... <br><br>hehe Lots of DPS and Mez ends up da kiter and last one standing second go round. wtg Mez<br><br><br>
