Loot Distribution|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|06/02/04 - 13:34:20|scottro|xx|12.20.105.98|Hey guys i have talked with several guys that have left FF and one of the biggest reasons seems to be Loot distribution. &nbsp;I know that several factors are taken into account when deciding but would like to get an overall feel of what everybody thinks of the considerations. &nbsp;To me there are :<br><br>1. Time in guild.<br>2. Raid attendance.<br>3. Need.<br>4. Usability (duh)<br><br>If i were to rank them it would be:<br><br>1. Usability (duh)<br>2. Raid attendance.<br>3. Need.<br>4. Time in guild.<br><br>I would be interested in seeing how everybody else feels about that. &nbsp;I know the single most important factor for IMO should be raid attendance. &nbsp;It does us no good to equip people who probably wont be around for next raid. &nbsp;It gets frustrating for the people attending 95%-100% of raids to equip people who attend about 20% of raids. &nbsp;Just my opinion. &nbsp;<br>
Re: Loot Distribution|Kanyu Diggit|pduchateau@new.rr.com|06/02/04 - 14:38:16|Kanyu_Diggit|xx|24.208.24.99|I agree pretty much with Sendace, being on raids and supporting the guild is huge in my book. After all...that is why we are a guild, to raid, get equipment and advance. Thos who take the time to attend as many raids as possible, should be rewarded for their efforts.<br><br>Oh yea...the company of great people isnt bad either =)<br><br><br>Kanyu Diggit?
Re: Loot Distribution|Briadorn|radracer_81@sbcglobal.net|06/02/04 - 22:07:04|Briadorn|xx|67.126.202.66|I totally agree with you Sendace. &nbsp;I will fight for those people that attend raids more than others to get gear. &nbsp;I feel it should only be rewarded on attendance, usability, and time spent in guild. &nbsp;I don't like to see gear handed out to people that rarely show up and leave with loot we have given them.<br><br>P.S. Sendace is a sack.

Re: Loot Distribution|Boredin|Ajiastormangel@yahoo.com|06/03/04 - 00:18:24|Boredin|xx|24.237.27.136|well sen's idea has some merits, but some people are on diff time zones, have jobs that dont allow constant play and my big issue with it would be almost all the raids we do are otm, so if they not posted how can one plan on being there?...now if peeps are on and not attending except occasionally then that is diff. I think priority should always be need before greed. if upgrade is marginal then roll would be fair other wise where is incentive to someone who logs and raid is forming but fall into the &quot;i dont have the time to play some folks do thing&quot; saying all this i have never got a drop yet and so what, stuff we working for is PP, gear we getting now is nickels and dimes compared to the gear there and if peeps are leaving because of loot, well...........no, i will be nice but sheesh. and they will find loot rules are pretty much the same in most guilds and even further apart in the big guilds, so lets do the need before greed and if someone was at a raid and spent there time taking down a mob then roll is fair otherwise why come, large part of the raids are pickup, on so many all the timers on.....ive seen this become a issue in every guild i have been in and it has destroyed them, we have way to much potential to start down this road and if peeps leave because of loot well thanks for playing and hope i see ya around.<br><br>P.S. SEN is a sack but i like him )[bones]

You will need to administer raid attendance. Also rate the different raids. Because doing a hedge raid should not count as much as a larger raid which would take more time.<br><br>2. You will have to schedule EVERY raid, otherwise people will start complaining that they where not informed and that it will look bad on their raid attendance.<br><br>What you suggest is a loot distribution system, which makes at the moment no sense for freefire (only my opinion) and would do more harm then good.<br><br>Distribution as it is now is quite ok. Only those that can use it and can with this upgrade give the largest contribution to the guild, NBG. Also time in guild is important here. <br><br>I rather have equipment go to someone who has proven its loyalty to the guild as to someone who is just in and may as well leave the next week (this has happend several times as you all know!) This does not mean that everyone who freshly joined should not get any loot! Its just one additional criteria, with a smaller weighting.<br><br>Oh, and the person should have attended the raid for atleast 80% off the raid duration of course! [grin]<br><br>Huggies to all! =)<br><br>Oh, I think some more transparenty would be welcome though. With loot distribution, but also with some other aspects of the guild. But thats just a general comment..<br><br>
Re: Loot Distribution|Ajia|ajiastormangel@yahoo.com|06/03/04 - 00:55:59|Ajia|xx|24.237.29.66|I agree with Bore you have to think of the fact that we have mostly otm raids not planned raids....so it is kinda unfair to say well if you don't attend all the raids you shouldn't get loot I think it should be based more on if you attend raids that are going on while you are on...the people who are too busy exping to raid is a lot different then the people who just don't happen to be on at the right time. ...I also agree with need before greed but you also have to think about who is taking the time to upgrade the char and who isn't...if you put a lot of time farming pp and ldon's to upgrade your gear to make it the best you can and then are not awarded loot at raids because other people didn't do this where is the incentive to try to upgrade yourself? People should not be looking to the guild for all of there upgrades it should be spread out to where someone is not always getting the drops...someone should be in charge of keeping track of who has gotten loot and who hasn't so that there is never one person or just a select few getting upgraded...we should be upgrading everyone where we can and they should be upgrading themselves at the sametime...saying this I also agree with Bore that there are very few things that would be upgrades for me at this point outside of EP or GoD gear...there is really only one thing I can think of and I have been trying to attend open raids to get that....it would be nice to get with the guild but really what I want out of the guild is Planer progression and friends to have fun with.<br><br>
Re: Loot Distribution|Kulaas|wtucker_1964@hotmail.com|06/03/04 - 03:51:37|Kulaas|xx|12.218.71.95|I too believe the need before greed approch is the best answer overall. Dedication to the cause being the deciding factor. The better your allies are equipped for battle, the more likely the chance you will survive yourself and move forward.<br><br>To be straight up, there are very very few raid drop items on the raids we are doing I would even consider rolling on, much less send an officer a tell about. It is good enough for me to see it go to the folks that can use the most. When and where I can attend I will. <br><br>Ajia is very much on the mark. Most upgrades will come from group outtings and things you get in pick up groups. No one should expect the guild to provide ALL your upgrades, nor should you expect raids to answer that need.<br><br>Yea, on raids there are gonna be drops that almost anyone would benefit from. But always remember to look at things from your friends eyes and take a bow on rolling or sending an officer a tell if you recently got an upgrade. How damn ubah will you &quot;really&quot; feel after winning 3 straight &quot;randoms&quot; on 3 different raids while a fellow hard working guild mate logs with no upgrade?<br><br>OTM raids? Hard call. OTM for older world mobs being the hardest. Non-Planar progression yet PoP mobs as second. I recall a few weeks back OTM being called to BoT for one of the tower mobs and 80% of the guild was in PoS doing back flag mobs. This really pissed me off because 60% of the folks there needed drops and only a few would get anything from a tower boss. <br><br>The power to call OTM for a target IMO should be carefully weighed. OTM too much has way of pissing off a lot of folks.<br><br>Well, (deep subject) .... My take on things.<br><br>
Re: Loot Distribution|Osmium|p.hendren@mchsi.com|06/03/04 - 06:59:29|Osmium|xx|12.217.81.133|Giving a high priority to raid attendance will only exacerbate the gear gulf between those of us with high playing times and others who are more casual. High timers already have an increased chance at loot by the very fact that they are around when it is disbursed. <br><br>There is already a sense in some players that only certain people &quot;ever&quot; get loot awards. Tying the loot to raid attendance would only exacerbate the problem in their eyes.<br><br>Freefire is Luminor's vision. A guild where players care about each other, help each other, work together, and the guild advances together as a unit. Not just in flagging, but in all aspects. Gear included.<br><br>I personally watched Luminor agonize over the loot rules for weeks before Freefire was formed. No system is perfect, but the current system is the best for Freefire. IMO.<br><br>Sendace, I love ya man, but ya gotta stop listening to the whining of those who have decided their loyalty lies with their gear before their guild. If they left because of the loot system, then loot is more important to them than the guild and its members. That is the definition of greed. <br><br>Do I want loot? Sure, but I don't see me getting any raid loot for a long time to come. This does not bother me. I serve a higher cause. <br><br>Luminor's vision. <br><br>Freefire.

Re: Loot Distribution|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|06/03/04 - 07:58:37|scottro|xx|12.20.105.98|One last thing. &nbsp;I think our peek time for people being logged in has shifted to around 9:00 CST. &nbsp;I think we should definately entertain the notion of raiding that late at night or both =) &nbsp;When all our raids are starting at around 4 ish CST that makes the californians have to be on at 2:00. &nbsp;I know , I know. &nbsp;Who cares about the californians? Well we have to be fair. &nbsp;I like all the california peeps except for briadorn. &nbsp; I think he is from the San Fran area. &nbsp;Seen him with rainbow flag in POK the other day.
