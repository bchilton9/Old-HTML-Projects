Needs Computer Help|Physt|markjdunham@hotmail.com|05/30/04 - 03:18:02|Physt|xx|154.11.37.44|Well, looks like i have done it..<br><br>My computer(laptop) plays EQ in window mode by default and yesterday i saw a new tab, Full Screen Mode, and thinking that it would allow me to play in a nonwindowed mode selected it.  When i selected it it booted me from the game and now when i try to log in after the pacther runs there is error and game crashes.  I know it is something with video card setting but cannot figure it out, and i was going to reinstall EQ, but as i am on the road do not have cds here, Well if anyone has any thoughts on what i should do please let me know, Thx<br>
