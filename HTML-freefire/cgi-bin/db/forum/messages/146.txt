Re: Carpin Cycle Info|Zmar|mduchateau13@yahoo.com|05/30/04 - 08:28:09|Zmar|xx|67.41.2.73|Only one that has mob spawn on each kill it gets is 2nd or 3rd one in cycle. &nbsp;Pets also count towards deaths so no weak pets like enchanter/shaman ones should be up, and if have pet up better have heal to keep it alive yourself to save healers mana:)

Re: Carpin Cycle Info|Killaana Moonshade|nightraiser@hotmail.com|05/30/04 - 23:42:26|Killaana|xx|80.139.177.240|I have two thoughts about this cycle and how I feel about it.<br><br>One is that we can beat it no problem as long as we have the numbers and time to do it. &nbsp;That everyone in the raid will have at least 3 hours to burn. &nbsp;<br><br>Second, I don't think we are ready for this cycle. &nbsp;Main reason is we never have enough ppl on in the guild to do a full raid. &nbsp;Also, if this only hands out 36 keys like Fit said then I know for a fact not many will come thinking they may not have a chance to get the key. &nbsp;I for one don't care if I do or don't. as long as I do some point in time. &nbsp;This guild needs a win like this, AD yes was a win, but this is far superior to that. &nbsp;This is a test of going through hell. &nbsp;Very long raid and a lot of enduring on it.<br><br>So my opinion we should wait until we straighten out some issues within the guild and start getting ppl to understand that raiding is part of this guild, either be part of it or go elsewhere. &nbsp;I don't mean to make it sound vague but that is my feeling on that subject. &nbsp;

Re: Carpin Cycle Info|Fitiala|ctroihd1@hotmail.com|06/02/04 - 08:32:09|Fitiala|xx|66.138.203.78|I for one, don't mind doing flagging over and over. &nbsp;To me, that is part of the Planar Progression, doing the events several times to get everyone flagged to move on. &nbsp;It is also a learning process for us all. &nbsp;We read up on the strategies, but actually doing them (more than once) and tweaking them to fit our abilities is what will make us stronger as a guild for progressing even further.
Re: Carpin Cycle Info|Faliela|kqa@cox.net|06/02/04 - 12:02:01|Faliela|xx|170.94.59.76|well said fiti...i agree completely<br><br>now quit hanging out on your alt missy and come show me some barbie lovin[nonsense]
