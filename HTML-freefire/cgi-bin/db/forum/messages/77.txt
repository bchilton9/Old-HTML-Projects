Aerin`Dar strats ... just some info|minddancer|mindancer20@yahoo.com|05/07/04 - 13:26:27|minddancer|xx|216.195.149.167|Summary: This fight is pretty simple, but it's still more complex than any other dragon you've fought in the game to date. Think Sontalak, now add in an AE fear, and 9 adds, and about 80k more hitpoints and you've got Aerin`Dar. <br><br>Aerin`Dar's Melee: Aerin`Dar quads for a max of 1400 per hit and rampages, but infrequently. Luckily, he's easily slowed. Some guilds actually pull him with two Shaman. One to malos, one to land slow.<br><br>Aerin`Dar's Spells: This is the mean part. This fight is out in the open; you can't hide from the AEs, so don't try. It's actually best to cluster your entire force very close to the main tank so that nobody gets hit with an AE, gets low-health-aggro, and ping-pong's the mob away from the melees who are trying to hit him. With above 300MR you can resist the AE, even so, it's a good idea to have a bard in the group with your Main Tank so that the MT doesn't get feared at all during the fight. Instruct your raid party to buff their magic resistance as high as possible. A feared cleric casts no spells. A feared rogue does no damage.<br>Proc: Glass Shards: This is the real tough one -- it slows your main tank by 45% (negating his haste). You need priests ready to cure disease to combat this AE if you want your MT to hold aggro at all.<br>Glass Roar: This is the troublemaker for everybody else. When feared, you do no damage. Casters will also get low-health aggro after a few ticks of this dot if you aren't particularly well-geared.<br>Shard of Glass: A standard, direct-damage DD spell. The real danger with this is that it'll be just enough to push someone into low-health-aggro range.<br><br><br>Triggered Events: Approximately every 10% of Aerin`Dar's health, one of the nine &quot;mindless minions&quot; surrounding him will awaken and head for your raid party. Depending on how fast you damage him, some of the golems may not activate at all. This is a bug, so plan on having them all wake up on you.<br><br>Buff Strategy: Try to avoid using up your cleric MGBs because you'll need them during the fight. As mentioned above, MR is very important, but so is DPS. Savagery is a good idea for your main tank. Make sure that everyone present has four buff slots available: two for MGB heals, two for Aerin`Dar's AEs. You don't want one of Aerin`Dar's AEs overwriting an important buff. Every class that can cast a pet (druids included!) should do so and make sure those pets are shrunk and clustered with the raid force. <br><br>Healing Strategy: Right before Aerin`Dar is pulled, have a druid MGB SoTW. Have a cleric MGB EE. Once Aerin`Dar is in, healers should simply assist him and heal his current target with fast, quick heals, no matter who he's after. He rampages; make sure you've got a strategy for healing the rampage taker -- it's a good idea to hotkey &quot;I'm on rampage!&quot; to your raid channel. With Aerin`Dar slowed, with fast assists by your healers, and with all tanks present taunting, you should suffer very few casualties. A conventional CH chain doesn't work well for this mob because clerics WILL get feared on occasion during the fight.<br><br><br>Pulling: You can pull Aerin`Dar with two Shaman (one to malos, one to Turgur). Or you can simply pull him conventionally. The most important thing to do is to set a rampage tank. To do this, have your main tank and second tank plink a couple arrows at the dragon while he's incoming. Your raid-force should be in a U-shape with the open end facing Aerin`Dar -- pull the dragon right into the bottom of the U and close the loop behind him. Now he's surrounded! Cluster tightly around him once he arrives in camp. You can't afford to have people spread out all over because this is a recipe for ping-pong aggro. Important: For such a huge dragon, Aerin'Dar's hit box is relatively small. You must keep people in close range to him and balance the melee push so that melee can connect and do damage. Refer to the map of his lair below:<br><br><br>Dealing with Adds: Split your druid team in half, one going to the left side of the cave, the other going to the right side of cave. Druids will root/snare and keep the Golems away from the main raid body. Root is very important as these minions are truly mindless -- they seem to be directly tied to Aerin`Dar's aggro list. If Aerin`Dar is mad at someone, the golems will also be mad at him and make a beeline for that player. If a minion makes it into the camp, have bards ready to highsunthem back to their spawn points. After Aerin`Dar is dead, have your entire raid force rush back to the wall where you all ported in and have druids bring golems to camp one by one.<br><br><br>Risk Management: If this is your first attempt at Aerin`Dar or if you're just a little unsure of how the fight will go, camp a cleric, necro, or paladin out inside the lair so that if you wipe you aren't forced to sit and wait thirty minutes on the graveyard. <br><br>Loot:<br>Double-edged Greatsword of Visions<br>Honorable Longsword<br>Honorary Amulet<br>Ring of Nobility<br>Shoulderpads of the Visionary<br>Valorious Quarterstaff<br>Wrath of Mithaniel<br><br>Flagging: This flag is largely useless. Thanks to the patch of June 10, 2003, you don't this flag to enter HoH. You also don't need the flag to enter the elemental planes. However, this flag DOES increase the power of your charm, so it's not entirely worthless. After Aerin`Dar is dead you'll need your raid to do two things: (1) Hail the projection (2) clear to HoH. First, hail the planar projection that spawns where Aerin`Dar used to stand, but warn everyone NOT to click the platform until everyone has hailed the projection. After everyone has hailed the projection, have ONE person click the platform. It will flip like a manhole cover and your raid party can jump into the water, swim a short distance through a tunnel, and come back out onto dry land. Now you've got some clearing to do. See the map below for the clearing path. It's pretty straight forward.<br><br><br>Reader Tips: Here's a collection of tips posted by readers.<br>Dasterminata says: My suggestion would be for all raidmembers to make a hotbutton: /tar a planar projection. If you die you have a limited time to get rezzed and back to the raid to hail the projection. It's likely you'll be rezzed back into a bunch of golems getting kited round the cave. Using your target a nearest NPC button(F8 by default), you'll prolly mistarget one of these golems<br><br>seems like we could take him but have we done Sontalak yet? if not would suggest doing him first then move on to this imo ....
