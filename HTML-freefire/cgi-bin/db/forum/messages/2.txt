Its all Lumis fault = (<br><br>becuse of the scare with this hacker guy luminor deleted all the boards from the site. He dident know that i had no way to recover any of the posts in the boards.<br><br>also for the class forms i dident add them back in becuse most of them where never used and they take up alot of space.<br><br>for future problems all admins will be shown the users ip address in the form posts then the ip address can be baned in the site admin area. so next time we have problems with anyone we can just ban there ip address insted of compleetly shuting down the site.<br><br>i have also changed the register process so that all new sign ups will need to be aproved by an admin insted of being automadicly aproved and set as a friend rank.<br><br>something is still not right with the register thingy insted of createding the acount when aproved it seems to be deleteing it so i will be working on that today.<br><br>Sorry iv been off line latly had alot of stuff happening and right now i only have a crapy dialup internet.
