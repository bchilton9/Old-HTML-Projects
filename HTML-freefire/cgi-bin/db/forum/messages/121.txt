Taking a break|Killaana Moonshade|nightraiser@hotmail.com|05/19/04 - 09:04:58|Killaana|xx|217.95.27.139|Just to let everyone know that I had a talk with Lumi, I was going to step down from being an officer after what heppened with TT. &nbsp;I still look at it as a fail but that's me...anyway, he talked me out of it as usual and we both decided that I need a break. &nbsp;Break from officer duty for a little while. &nbsp;I will not be demoted but I will sit back for a few and relax and not lead any raids. &nbsp;It may be my new job's stress combined with the stress of leading TT and other things like flagging. &nbsp;But I was very stressed after TT and pissed at the same time. &nbsp;I was ready to leave the guild but Tohdai talked me out of that one. &nbsp;She told me to sleep on it and I did. &nbsp;So don't be alarmed if I am not acting like a usually do. &nbsp;Just taking a break, will still be in game and will help if needed but like I said. &nbsp;Just for a little while I need a break.
Re: Taking a break|Faliela|kqa@cox.net|05/19/04 - 12:17:08|Faliela|xx|170.94.59.76|Killaana, I completely understand and respect your decision.  <br><br>I'm not sure i'm reading it correctly, but it seems you are blaming yourself for the lack of flagging at TT.  I hope that's not the case.  I personally thought you did a good job explaining the script and what it was we were supposed to do.  As raid leader that's all you can do, the guild/raid has to do the rest. In my opinion some confusion is to be expected on mobs of that degree the 1st time we attempt them.  Honestly I was completely expecting to wipe on her.  So I don't view the raid as a total failure.<br><br>One thing that I think would've helped your stress level and ability to manage the fight would have been if you were not the main tank.  I personally don't think the puller or the main tank should ever be the raid leader. (unless you're ubah luminor who must have 2 heads and 14 hands)  Once you went down you couldn't see what was happening therefore you were unable to react and respond to the developing situation.  <br><br>If Soxx hadn't hailed the planar dude (sorry can't think of what he's called) we still would've gotten flagged even w/ the large majority dying as we did. I was rezzed in and tl'd out so the cr was successful.<br><br>Anyway, don't be too hard on yourself.  Enjoy your break and I hope &quot;we&quot; are okay.  I never got a chance to talk one on one w/ you after Sunday night in BoT when you were upset.  <br><br>oh and are you still up to main tanking for us or would you rather we assign that job to someone else for a while??
