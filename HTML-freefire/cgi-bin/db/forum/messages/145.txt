Re: LDON Raids|Gorran|jonasvalen@yahoo.no|05/28/04 - 01:45:37|Gorran|xx|80.202.126.103|From what i understand LDoN raids are ment for time and ep geared guilds. They are extremely time consuming and i think there are several hours worth of clearing mobs before you get to your target. I think mostly augs drop off the bosses, but other nice items drop too. Friends in Europa tell me they whipe on them all the time, but thats probably on hard, and i dont know how big of a difference there is. The time limit is also been called unreasonable, and i think that is a big problem why more guilds dont do them.<br><br>I'm willing to try one just to see what they are, and not have to rely on other people for information.
