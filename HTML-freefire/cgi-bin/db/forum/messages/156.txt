A Time to Band Together and Act|Klassy Truheart|webmaster@eqguilded.com|05/27/04 - 08:00:35|klassy|xx|24.8.91.122|As many of you know, Last night Luminor logged on and said into officer chat that he was going to disband FF because he has 4 months of long shifts ahead of him. He said he didnt want anyone else running the guild, and he said he didnt know what else to do. Well, I am posting this message in regards to what we discussed in officers chat last night after he logged. We need to band together officers. We need to hold an officers meeting and compromise to get along amongest ourselves and run this guild as officers excluding no one. If we dont want to see FF fall, then we need to prove to Lumi that as officers from this moment on we can run this guild and get through this tough time. I need to know whos still there for Freefire. Who still cares who doesnt want to let go. I dont want to take charge either, I just want to know who is with me. Please post times that you are avalible to hold an officers meeting to address these issues. If no one posts then FF will fall because that way it will appear to me that no one wants to make an effort to save this guild. So please officers stand behind this guild that you are all so very proud of and let me know so as officers we can set the best time to assure all officers get in there, and get there amount of say so. We need all officers there if possible. I would hate to see this guild bite the dust after all we have been through and how far we have already progressed. Its a game its fun. If you want to have fun in FF, then you need make your effort to have fun sort out your personal issues with other officers and get along. I am avaliable Monday of next week at best but can probably work out a time for sooner then that if need be. Please guys show your support and lets run this guild cleanly and flawlessly till Lumi gets back. =)

I agree with Killa, and I truly hope &nbsp;Lumi doesn't do that. Perhapse we should come up with some sort of heirarchy of control.. i.e. Generals, Colnels, Majors, Lieutenants... etc...<br>Thoughts?<br><br>Joradan Icebender
