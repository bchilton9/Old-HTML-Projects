Re: SSRA|Osmium|p.hendren@mchsi.com|05/25/04 - 22:34:52|Osmium|xx|64.22.217.225|I have heard that a current guild that is just a few steps ahead of us, is planning on skipping Ssra/VT in their progression thru the planes. I know that VE and IG tried to do this and realized that they had to do Ssra/VT to get geared up enough for Sol Ro.<br><br>I am asking some people in the know as to when we should switch our focus from PoP gods to SSra/VT. Will post the info when I have a handle on it.<br><br>With the new Lvl 70 cap though, it may just be possible to advance thru planar progression w/o SSra/VT. Guess we'll find out soon enough.<br><br>Os<br>

Re: SSRA|Fitiala|ctroihd1@hotmail.com|05/26/04 - 10:05:03|Fitiala|xx|65.71.236.181|I read about that 100 AA per lvl past 65, also. &nbsp;But then they went on to say that it is a RUMOR. &nbsp;Although, in theory, It would make sense to attach some AA requirement onto the levels such as 20 or 25, IMHO....
