Re: Current Roster|crickket|crickket212000@yahoo.com|05/26/04 - 10:14:28|crickket|xx|65.117.222.53|Yeah thats what &nbsp;I am saying &nbsp;there alot of people who haven't been on &nbsp;for very long time ,, I have and idea for raids ,, I know how we been putting necros with healers, If we had enough shadownights ,, with healers as well in groups &nbsp;it would &nbsp;be very &nbsp;hard for them to run low on mana ,,For a druid who doesn't have &nbsp;much mana pull as &nbsp;clerics &nbsp;on healing &nbsp;it was awsome ,, I felt like I was gimp ,,hehe,, Just thoughts, I love the way our raids groups get set up now,, Anyways hope to see ya soon in game patch holding us up lol..[smile]
