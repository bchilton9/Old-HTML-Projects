HoH Trials ( Rydda`Dar)|Sinnuster|evilchanter@yahoo.com|05/26/04 - 08:27:56|Sinnuster|xx|129.120.69.64|Considering how often Rydda `Dar seems to eat raids, one might think there is some highly complex strategy to this encounter and become easily frustrated... but there really is not. The following tips should make your raid much, much easier however: <br><br>IMPORTANT: the NPC you first engage is the placeholder for RD... she will pop in exactly the spot where he dies, and will immediately aggro whomever got the kill shot. Obviously, we want that person to be your MT. Everyone MUST get OFF the trigger NPC and allow the MT to finish him off. This is crucial. NO NUKES... you might crit and end up getting the kill. back off when the PH is down to 10% to be safe and let your MT get the last whacks. <br><br>As soon as the PH is dead, you will have a nasty dragon on your hands... and her DPS is almost godly... <br><br>The MT should immediately activate &quot;Furious,&quot; and engage RD. This ability will automatically riposte almost every melee attack made upon your MT, and DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of damage he takes in the 12 seconds before &quot;Furious&quot; runs down. Since most RD raids wipe during this first 10 or so seconds (because the MT is slaughtered), this will allow us to get a few things happening... <br><br>After MT engages, an Enchanter must cast &quot;Howl of Tashan&quot; or whatever it is called on RD. This is a 100% non-resistable tash, and allows RD to be further debuffed. Once that has been done, the chanter (if he or she lives... hee hee) can join the healer camp and try to cast Rune buffs on the MT to further cut down on the dmg he takes. Watch your aggro as always. <br><br>MT should taunt with &quot;Incite&quot; as soon as possible... this again will buy a little time during the debuffing process, as well as get the MT nice and high on the hate list. <br><br>Have a PAIR of shammies ready to SLOW this beast just as soon as the chanter calls out &quot;Rydda `Dar is TASHED.&quot; Remember... we have all of 12 seconds to both tash, and slow, this dragon. After that, the MT's &quot;Furious&quot; deal will run out, and he will then be taking every single hit RD dishes out. We absolutely MUST get her debuffed and slowed before that happens. Have 2 shammies both casting slows on RD... this doubles the chance that one will actually land. Also, if one happens to pull aggro for some reason and get whacked, another is still casting at same time. Trust me on this, just get this freak slowed ASAP. You may need to use DR slows if other types are still resisted after RD has been tashed. <br><br>Healers... do not wait for the MT to be hurt before you heal him. Start right in spamming the MT with every fast casting heal and heal over time that you have. Work out an order and keep a good rhythm going. Forget CHeals... 10 seconds cast time is too long. Have multiple Clerics doing fast heals instead. If your shammies live thru the debuffing process, they and other priests like Druids can also likewise spam your tank with heals and cures (RD procs a DD/DoT). <br><br>Do not worry too much about healer mana... this fight should not take very long. Just use your common sense. The biggest waste of mana would be 2 or 3 of you casting redundant heals on the same target. I can not say this enough: keep your healing chains ORGANISED. Tune out everything else going on about you and just work with the other healers. <br><br>Place at least one Bard in the healer camp, and start singing stuffs like &quot;Elemental Chorus.&quot; We want to make sure none of the Clerics get hit too hard by the AE's from Rydda `Dar. <br><br>Place another Bard in between the caster camp, and RD... the idea here is to have the nukers run toward RD to nuke... coming into range of the Bard songs... and that way, being additionally protected so they can dump their mana. The nukers on this raid are important... they are going to be dishing out an enormous amount of very fast damage, which is a big key to winning this encounter. Keeping them alive can not be an issue for the healers... so our Bard(s) will give us a very nice alternative. <br><br>Rangers can engage well before the casters do. <br><br>Everyone TURN OFF RUN, and just walk. Click off any SoW or other run speed buffs. That way, if you are Feared, you will not go very far before you can quickly SIT DOWN until it wears off (which is fast... the Fear effect lasts for perhaps one tick). <br><br>To actually kill RD is pretty much to just engage with your plate clads first (when MT calls Assist), chain classes next, pets and leather classes a few seconds afterward, and then, casters last... <br><br>Do not nuke this mob before it is down to about 70%... which should not take long. Let the Rangers and other melee classes (and pets) do the initial damages. At 70%, and assuming you have enough blasters (you better..!), run toward your Bard (who should be singing MR and heal tunes, just like the bard in the healer camp) and get in range of RD... then just nuke your brains out. This is a &quot;do or die&quot; battle, so dump your mana bar. A Manaburn here is fine, but simply chain nuking with things like Strike of Solusek and Agnarr's Thunder will be just peachy. With enough of you nuking at same time, the aggro will balance in such a way as to keep RD constantly bombarded, trying to decide who to kill, and of course, not actually getting much chance to kill anyone at all. Use this to your advantage and blast her brains out. <br><br>Done efficiently, this entire battle should not last much longer than 2 minutes I should think, although I never have actually timed it. Maximise your DPS and keep your MT alive, and this trial is a done deal. <br>========================================<br>Rydda`Dar - Level 70<br>Casts:<br>Screeching Bellow - (MR -200) PB AE0 Decreese hp by 2500, 700hp/tick dot<br>Crystal Roar - (MR-200) AE300' fear, snare, slow
