Something different|Killaana Moonshade|nightraiser@hotmail.com|05/07/04 - 09:08:00|Killaana|xx|80.139.186.196|Okay, this may be a bit blurted out but oh well. &nbsp;We need to start going after bigger mobs now. &nbsp;BoT is a tease for us now. &nbsp;We know BoT like the back of our hands and people are getting bored with it including myself. &nbsp;I know Lumi want to keep hitting BoT for gear but you get gear wherever you go to raid. &nbsp;We need to relay our road again and look forward and see what we can take out next. &nbsp;I would start with AD(aerin dar)the PoV dragon, then grummus and I say we go for the HoH trials too. &nbsp;AD flags you for HoH then we do trials. &nbsp;Once we have the trials down we will rule. &nbsp;It will not only give us good practice but it's harder and more challenging and I think that is exactly what we need to get better.<br><br>Our members are getting lazy, I see this and so do a lot of others. &nbsp;I think the solution to our not listening in raids is to fail. &nbsp;This may sound strange but I think we need a few fails to get people to start taking this raiding more seriously. &nbsp;We have been raiding BoT for so long they are starting to think that is what raiding is all about. &nbsp;We need to show them just how hard it can be. &nbsp;I don't care if we fail, we need to sometimes. &nbsp;Not only to learn from our mistakes but to show people that if you don't listen you fail, plain and simple. &nbsp;Maybe then they will start to think to themselves that what if i did this or that, then it will also make them try harder next time. &nbsp;This is just my approach to this. &nbsp;If anyone disagrees please say so and don't hold back. &nbsp;If you agree then also say something and back my ass up. &nbsp;Let's make a move now before we widdle down and die.<br><br>If you remember MB, we failed on him everytime, we kept going back until we succeeded and beat his ass. &nbsp;We failed again after beating so you see, there is always room for improvement. &nbsp;But this is just an example of what we can do if we keep trying again and again if we don't suceed. &nbsp;Let's do this, this is Freefire, the home of people with fire in there heart's and there blood, we fail at time, we cry at times, but we will never give up, I know I won't. &nbsp;I'm in this for the long hull and won't leave. &nbsp;I love this damn guild and the people in it. &nbsp;But we need to do something now.

Re: Something different|Sinnuster|evilchanter@yahoo.com|05/07/04 - 10:57:27|Sinnuster|xx|24.0.181.153|I would like to do other mobs too, but there are still some that need upgrades from BoT Towers.<br><br>If we want to talk about how easy BoT towers are, then lets start farming them with smaller groups.  6-12 people going up and taking out the minis for the gear.  <br><br>I would be down to try any of the towers in a smaller raid/group situation.  This would also make it easier for us to get more keys for Agnarr.  I need the wind sphere to complete mine, and I know most are only 1 or 2 drops from completing.<br><br>As far as knew targets goes, I am in to see what else is out there for us to beat on.  Nathyn Illuminate in Katta has my robe (or one of my robes).  I here a small raid of 10 or so can own him.  His  robe is +100 CHA.  Would free up alot of slots for me personally.<br><br>I think what I was getting at when i started in about my robe is that we still need upgrades and if we are past the point of the bot towers then lets figure out some mobs we can do smaller otms for so that we can grab 2 groups and go kill some mobs real fast and get upgrades.<br><br>Freefire certainly has the manpower and ability.  We do still need better gear.<br><br>my 2 cp.

Bot towers, emp - VT is whats going to gear us for EP those are the steps we would need to take to get geared well enough imo things will get boring but thing to remember is every guild farmed bot emp and VT for awhile before going EP ... just my thoughts
Re: Something different|Killaana Moonshade|nightraiser@hotmail.com|05/08/04 - 00:12:41|Killaana|xx|80.139.186.196|Only one prob with that mind, a lot of ppl aren't even interested in getting there VT key. &nbsp;I myself have 3 shards now and am always in the mood for hunting down more. &nbsp;But as a warrior i can't solo where i need to go now for the others. &nbsp;I need help but whenever i ask no one wants to help because the mobs are green or light blue. &nbsp;I tried starting a group to go and just do VT shards but I guess that fell thru the water. &nbsp;But whenever any of you are interested in hunting down shards count me in.
Re: Something different|minddancer|mindancer20@yahoo.com|05/08/04 - 09:44:31|minddancer|xx|216.195.147.172|If no ones interested in VT then they wont get to EP... and there in the wrong guild as far as i can see. Honestly only way to get geared for EP is VT ask any high end guild how they did it and they will tell u it was threw VT maybe we need to make our members aware that VT is a huge stepping stone to EP...Problem is everyone wants EP but don't want to work to get there. And that is going to slow FF down considerably. bot will not gear us for EP it will tho gear us for alot of planar pregression not all though. As of now i have orb rift from emp and i think 6 of my shards or more but whenever u need a chanter for shards just send a tell hun. People need to get there butts in gear if they want EP like lumi said before we don't want lazy people and this trains ready to roll ..... think we need a cheerleader or something to get these guys going lol ....
