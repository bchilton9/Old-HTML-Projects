LDON Raid|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|05/25/04 - 23:32:58|scottro|xx|66.233.90.144|Ok lets try one for tonight(Wednesday) at 7:00 CST. &nbsp;Will be lots of fun. &nbsp;Please post if you are planning on attending. &nbsp;At the very worst we will have our raiding skills tested to the max and lose a tad of xp. &nbsp;From the sounds of it a Monk (FD) puller is needed for this. &nbsp;THIS IS NOT REQIURED!!!! &nbsp;Totally my idea. &nbsp;Don't come if ya dont want to. &nbsp;I find myself not excited about logging in without the potential of a raid. &nbsp;=/ &nbsp;Thats why I'm here.<br><br>WOW 175 points for the win...<br><br>[grin]
