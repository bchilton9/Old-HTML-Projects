Re: Fear Raid list|Zilo|deltic@mc.net|05/31/04 - 00:03:36|Zilo|xx|24.15.240.240|Well we kinda went to Fear today. &nbsp;Unfortunatly after getting in to fear most wanted to leave so, well we left without getting anything major. &nbsp;I have another Guild MQing my Fear item with me hopefully later on today. &nbsp;But I would still like an officer if possible to plan a Fear raid to get the rest of the items off these posts. &nbsp;While wipe is probably going to happen that was still sort of fun breaking in to the zone and there's still a lot of items that are needed by many of the members of the guild. &nbsp;When would be the best time to schedule a raid like this? &nbsp;Freefire needs to bring fear to the plane of fear!<br><br>Zilo
