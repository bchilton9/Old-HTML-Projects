TT raid on Monday|Osmium|p.hendren@mchsi.com|05/18/04 - 07:06:04|Osmium|xx|12.217.81.133|Hi guys,<br><br>Just some observations and suggstions for our next whack at TT.<br><br>I knew we could take her down, the question was, would we? Well, now we know for a fact that we can!! So we can relax during the raid, and focus.<br><br>WE ALL need to pay attention to TT's health and follow the script as outlined by the raid leader.<br><br>The main problem last night was with the butterflies. VERY few people did as they were told during this phase. So, we need to improve our listening skills and we need to improve our tactics during the butterfly phase. There was still a butterfly left in the zone after everyone else had been rezzed and left!! If we had dealt with the butterflies properly, the gargoyles would have been no problem, and the victory would have been flawless, or nearly so. <br><br>There is no need to rush through this encounter. It isn't a race to get TT deaded. Cool heads will result in a flawless victory.<br><br>So:<br><br>1. At 75% health EVERYONE but the MT and healers must begin killing butterflies. Did I say EVERYONE? OK, thought so. <br><br>We should probably designate a tank in each group, and each group assists their tank ONLY during the butterfly phase. Any plate/chain class will do as long as they are assisted, even us squishy rogues. ;-) This works for the AoEer's too. NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE should be using AutoAttack except for the group tank. <br><br>Another option is to have the Gargoyle tanks be the only tanks during the Butterfly phase as well. Each group is assigned an off-tank to assist and makes an appropriate hotkey.<br><br>If, for some reason, you find that the butterflies are whacking on you, DO NOT just go back to killing TT! Follow the script. Find someone to assist.<br><br>It wasn't pretty, but it WAS a victory. And like Sinnuster said, any victory against a PoP god is Awesome!! [grin]<br><br>I LOVE this guild!!!!<br><br>Os<br><br>

Re: TT raid on Monday|Sendace|scott.gregory@la-z-boy.com|05/18/04 - 10:54:27|scottro|xx|12.20.105.98|Another possibility is to start AE's at 77%. &nbsp;so as soon as butterflies pop they have some stunnage/nukage on their arse. &nbsp;I saw the butterflies for about two seconds. Around 5 of them to be exact then:<br>&lt;&lt; loading, loading please wait... &gt;&gt;<br><br>Also from being in cleric channel as well during the fight a 2 cleric CH rotation is not enough to keep Tank up. &nbsp;3 would be ok I think but 4 would be prime.<br><br>CH is something that is gonna bite us in the butt in later fights if we dont practice and get it down now on these lesser mobs. &nbsp;Any tank can tell you we need work in this area. &nbsp;I say that every mob we hit from here on out we get a rotation set up so we can start to gel a little bit in this area. &nbsp;I know some mobs take a &quot;fastheal&quot; spam but really if CH rotation can be used it should be. &nbsp;IMO this is VITAL.

Re: TT raid on Monday|Drizzlen|nemacice@ptd.net|05/18/04 - 14:15:12|Drizzlen|xx|24.229.129.93|Hey everyone!<br>Just a suggestion I thought of last night.<br>This is to officers. <br>We had 7 chanters there.<br>What if all 7 made a line for the casters to fall back to if they are hit by bugs? Have enchanters take a Known chanter form so easy to notice.<br>Enchanters just keep stunning that way casters should never get interupted.<br>I'm sure this suggestion needs some work but didn't know if anyone thought of it or if any one thought it may come in handy.<br><br>P.S. Ganna work on my sig. and Pic later. I had one from last guild but I threw it out.Till then...<br><br>Drizzlen Mooncloud<br>65 Dark Elf Enchanter<br>At your service.
Re: TT raid on Monday|Nukes|dztrb@hotmail.com|05/18/04 - 14:57:41|nukes|xx|24.228.82.178|as long as the AE's (that includes chanters, r at TT's feet, and the butterflies r pulled there, it shoudl be tight enuf that all the enchanters hit all the butterflies, and the nukers ae's will hti TT, which means a little low agro extra dps on her while everyone is on the butterflies
Re: TT raid on Monday|Kulaas|wtucker_1964@hotmail.com|05/19/04 - 02:59:51|Kulaas|xx|12.218.71.95|I saw the flies spawn but stayed on TT untill I saw folks dropping left and right and snared some and rooted a few to the side. At that point I went back to TT until the debuff and did MGB SoP.... have no clue who it hit. After that we had flies, and Gargs right as TT went down. I was kiting a garg around when I died. <br><br>Also, I am 99% sure the flies popped when TT was well below 75% and seems like the debuff happened when she was lower than 50% but was alot going on to deal with for me to be sure. I had at least 2 flies break root and start smacking me after TT was down and I was trying to help with gargs.<br><br>All I saw <br><br>
Re: TT raid on Monday|Fitiala|ctroihd1@hotmail.com|05/19/04 - 06:25:02|Fitiala|xx|65.71.236.199|I'm not sure exactly when the butterflies did spawn in relation to TT's health. &nbsp;I was waiting for the flies and looking for them, but didn't see any until much later. &nbsp;TT's AE debuff did happen right at the 50% mark though.
Re: TT raid on Monday|Sinnuster|evilchanter@yahoo.com|05/19/04 - 07:19:35|Sinnuster|xx|129.120.69.64|The Butterflies spawned on time, but they spawned by the entrance to her lair.  They aggro'd the people that were there at entrance and didn't pull into the pack as they usually do.<br><br>In the future we will have to make sure people know to bring them straight towards TT so they are stunned.
Re: TT raid on Monday|Drizzlen|nemacice@ptd.net|05/19/04 - 14:25:16|Drizzlen|question|24.229.129.93|continuation....<br>The butterflys.<br>Ok Why move chanters with TT?<br>Chanters just ganna get hit with ae's why not keep them back near Entrance?<br>Keep all chanters togather stunning.<br>This is a safe casting/dps/healing radius now.<br>Have MA start targeting and do what they do,yea they ganna get hit but no one esle will right ?<br>I know there may be something I'm missing but could you help me understand why chanters are following TT instead of standig still AE'ing stun ?<br>That way this area is our caster area.<br>If direct melee are the only ones out of this area I don't see how we could be stopped.<br>Please no one take this personal!<br>We did a great Job allready on TT.<br>I have heard Opinions are like A holes.<br>Well,I have one. I also realize a silent one could be deadlier.<br>[oops]<br>Looking forward to replys.<br><br>
Re: TT raid on Monday|Nukes|dztrb@hotmail.com|05/19/04 - 18:56:34|nukes|xx|24.228.82.178|TT doesn't really move, and she doesn't AE, from wut i have seen ive never been hit by an AE (not including the dispell at 50%), chanters should stand at TT's feet(she doesn't really move at all maybe shes perma rooted idk) so that they can stun the butterflies there, this allows all teh AE nukers to hit both the butterflies and TT herself, it helps save mana and work on TT's life. thats the strat most use for TT, and seems to work well, but we can try wut ever works best for us [rolleyes]

Re: TT raid on Monday|Fitiala|ctroihd1@hotmail.com|05/20/04 - 06:20:23|Fitiala|xx|65.71.236.218|I believe one reason to have the butterflies brought to TT is to keep the force together so we don't get all spread out. &nbsp;Plus it is easier to follow the script if you don't have to move too far. &nbsp;It makes for a smooth transition for the melee to take down the butterflies then quickly switch (instead of running back) to TT. &nbsp;You get too many people spread too far apart, and then healing and rebuffing can become a problem. &nbsp;The script on TT moves very fast if we don't control it, as we have already seen.
