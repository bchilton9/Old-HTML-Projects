Fear Raid?|Zilo|deltic@mc.net|05/26/04 - 00:42:54|Zilo|xx|24.15.240.240|Well I know Sendance, Sinnuster, Killaana, and I all need drops from Fear for our respective Epics. &nbsp;Would it be possible to assemble the huge PoP raid force to maybe knock out all these items in one shot. &nbsp;I've heard how peeps hate fear so if we can get them all done at once it'd probably be a good thing?<br><br>Zilo
