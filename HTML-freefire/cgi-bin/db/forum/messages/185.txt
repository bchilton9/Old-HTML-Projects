 Sorry |crickket|crickket212000@yahoo.com|06/03/04 - 02:22:42|crickket|xx|65.117.222.53| I am sorry &nbsp;for &nbsp;showing my anger this morning in &nbsp;officer chat I was hopeing this situation &nbsp;would be solved , &nbsp;But &nbsp;to come to find out &nbsp;the situation &nbsp;was going on , with out being handled the way I thought it would be handle. meaning that &nbsp;officer discuss the problems they are having instead it was differently ,I am sharing my thoughts here I think that what happen &nbsp;how someone delt with my comments was very wrong ,, instead of taking it to officer1 channel or &nbsp;trying to get to the starting point , of the situation ,, It was delt with &nbsp;a very different &nbsp;way .. A way that &nbsp;has effected us all , There was no need for all this stuff to have happened, the way it did. I am sick of the lies and jealousy ,and the backstabbing we just had a meeting &nbsp;about &nbsp;how we can better our selves and this guild , &nbsp;And whats funny &nbsp;is the true colors finally start showing ,I hope to get this situation solved ,Zilo and I have discuss things &nbsp;and we have pinpoint the &nbsp;problem to this. I am sorry this problem got out of control ,I have learned from this &nbsp;experiance ,Not only the problems that went wrong with &nbsp;this situation ,, But also &nbsp;found out &nbsp;new problems that verify Some of &nbsp;the problem I been dealing with in tells with guildies , Ihope tomorrow we can sit &nbsp;down and sort all this stuff..
