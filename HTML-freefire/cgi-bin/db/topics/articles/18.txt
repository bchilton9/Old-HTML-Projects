Hedge Maze taken down once again|Killaana Moonshade|Killaana|nightraiser@hotmail.com|03/06/04 - 05:58:40|Last night on Friday we did the hedge maze once again. &nbsp;It started out slow trying to get people to go but once we started we were on it. &nbsp;Great job to those who got your new flag. &nbsp;Getting closer and closer to TT.
