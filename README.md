# Legacy HTML Code Archive

This is some very old HTML code I wrote or used years ago. It’s not actively maintained or intended for reuse, but I’ve kept it here for reference and archival purposes.

If you’re curious or can learn something from it — feel free to dig in. Just be aware that it reflects a much earlier stage of development practices and tooling.

Use at your own discretion.
